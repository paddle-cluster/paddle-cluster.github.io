Furthermore, aspects of gender and gendered technology use has been a part of her research and she has developed research on the governance and changing disciplinary career orientations for Doctoral Education. Lately, the policy and governance interest has translated into empirical studies on policy network formations, connecting public and commercial interests and actors within IT education policy area. Currently, the empirical interest of digitization of education has widened to the digitization of schools and digital platforms.</p><p>Annika recently finalized a three-year research project funded by the Swedish Research Council, investigating and problematizing how teachers use social media for professional learning and digital work outside the formal school and workplace. Empirically, the project is based on advanced computational data on the interactions and norms of professional social media and resources shared. For a popular science article on this social media project (in Swedish): <a href="https://www.sics.se/media/news/hur-fungerar-larares-kollegiala-larande-pa-facebook">https://www.sics.se/media/news/hur-fungerar-larares-kollegiala-larande-pa-facebook</a></p><p>Annika is also involved in research with a group of international scholars within the field of digital governance and policy sociology, which has resulted in publications within the field of policy sociology studies, on trans-national policy networks, policy network events. One study for example have problematized the so-called edu-business surrounding current policy-making within educational technology, and the lobby and industry around the curriculum policy issue of programming in schools.</p><p>In 2016, Annika was awarded as Excellent Teaching Practitioner at the Faculty of Education, University of Gothenburg, and she has a wide experience of teaching and pedagogical development, also in leadership roles. She is currently Deputy Head of Department with special responsibility for education quality.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">This site is based on the <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/product/simple/">Simple</a> theme and built with the <a href="https://getpublii.com">Publii</a> static site CMS.</div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://paddle-cluster.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
