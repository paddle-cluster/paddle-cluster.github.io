abstract={This article presents a theoretical examination of the digital divide, tracing its origins in the centre-Left social inclusion policy agenda of the 1980s and 1990s to its current status of political 'hot topic'. It then moves on to outline four conceptual limitations to conventional dichotomous notions of the digital divide and individuals' 'access' to information and communications technology (ICT): what is meant by ICT; what is meant by 'access'; the relationship between 'access to ICT' and 'use of ICT'; and a lack of consideration of the consequences of engagement with ICT. The article outlines a more sophisticated, hierarchical model of the digital divide based around these conceptual 'stages' while recognizing the mediating role of economic, cultural and social forms of capital in shaping individuals' engagements with ICT. It concludes by developing a set of research themes and questions for future examination of inequalities in individuals' use of ICT.},

abstract={Social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace have been subject to much recent debate within the educational community. Whilst growing numbers of educators celebrate the potential of social networking to (re)engage learners with their studies, others fear that such applications compromise and disrupt young people's engagement with 'traditional' education provision. With these ongoing debates in mind, the current paper presents an in-depth qualitative analysis of the Facebook 'wall' activity of 909 undergraduate students in a UK university. Analysis of these data shows how much of students' education-related use of this social networking application was based around either the post-hoc critiquing of learning experiences and events, the exchange of logistical or factual information about teaching and assessment requirements, instances of supplication and moral support with regards to assessment or learning, or the promotion of oneself as academically incompetent and/or disengaged. With these themes in mind, the paper concludes that rather than necessarily enhancing or eroding students' 'front-stage' engagement with their formal studies, Facebook use must be seen as being situated within the 'identity politics' of being a student. In particular, Facebook appears to provide a ready space where the 'role conflict' that students often experience in their relationships with university work, teaching staff, academic conventions and expectations can be worked through in a relatively closed 'backstage' area.},

abstract={Social commentators in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are beginning to recognise that encouraging older adults' use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is essential for the creation of bona fide information societies. To date, however, few studies have examined in detail older adults' access to and use of ICTs. This important aspect of the interaction between population ageing and societal change is more complex than the published literature's portrayal of a dichotomy between 'successful users' and 'unsuccessful non-users'. The paper examines the extent and nature of ICT access and use by older adults in their everyday lives. Information was collected from a sub-sample of 352 adults aged 60 or more years taken from a large household survey of ICT use in England and Wales among 1,001 people. The findings suggest that using a computer is not only a minority activity amongst older adults but also highly stratified by gender, age, marital status and educational background. Conversely, non-use of computers can be attributed to their low relevance and 'relative advantage' to older people. The paper concludes by considering how political and academic assumptions about older people and ICTs might be refocused, away from trying to'change' older adults, and towards involving them in changing ICT.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and promote a realistic understanding of young people and digital technology with a view to supporting information professionals in playing useful and meaningful roles in supporting current generations of young people. In particular the paper aims to offer a critical perspective on popular and political understandings of young people and digital technologies - characterised by notions of digital natives, the net generation and other commonsense portrayals of expert young technology users. The paper seeks to consider the accuracy of such descriptions in reflecting young people's actual uses of digital technology and digital information. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent published literatures on young people and digital technology in information sciences, education studies and media/communication studies. Findings: The findings show that young people's engagements with digital technologies are varied and often unspectacular - in stark contrast to popular portrayals of the digital native. As such, the paper highlights a misplaced technological and biological determinism that underpins current portrayals of children, young people and digital technology. Originality/value: The paper challenges the popular assumption that current generations of children and young people are innate, talented users of digital technologies. Having presented a more realistic basis for approaching generational differences in technology use, the paper explores the functions and roles that information professionals can be expected to play in supporting young people in the digital age. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Despite huge efforts to position information and communication technology (ICT) as a central tenet of university teaching and learning, the fact remains that many university students and faculty make only limited formal academic use of computer technology. Whilst this is usually attributed to a variety of operational deficits on the part of students, faculty, and universities, this paper considers the wider social relations underpinning the relatively modest use of technology in higher education. The paper explores how university use of computer technology is shaped into marginalized and curtailed positions by a variety of actors. From the 'writing' of ICT at a national policy level through to the marginalization of ICT within the lived 'student experience', a consistent theme emerges where computer technology use is constructed in limited, linear, and rigid terms far removed from the creative, productive, and empowering uses which are often celebrated by educational technologists. In the light of such constraints, the paper considers how these dominant constructions of a peripheral and limited use of ICT may be challenged by the higher education community. In particular, it concludes by reflecting on current critical thinking about how educational technologists can foster a more expansive and empowered use of computer technology within university settings. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Although it is widely perceived that older adults should be making more use of information and communications technology (ICT), academic studies in this area have been limited, especially from a sociological perspective. We still know little, for example, about the reasons and motivations underlying older adults' adoption or nonadoption of ICTs. We also know little about the nature of this use and the support that older adults draw upon regarding ICTs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we know little about the outcomes and "life-fit" of older adults' (non)use of ICTs. Drawing upon in-depth interview data from 35 individuals aged over 60 years (collected as part of a larger research project looking at adults' use of ICT), this article addresses these issues of older adults' adoption, nonadoption, and use of ICT. From this analysis, the article highlights the key issue of many older adults' ambivalence toward ICT in light of the limited relevance of new technologies to their day-to-day lives. The article concludes by considering what steps can be taken to facilitate wider use of ICT by older adults. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Despite the high-profile nature of the current 'digital divide' debate, academic understanding of who is making little or no use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) remains weak. Indeed much of the discussion surrounding the digital divide has concentrated on the characteristics of those individuals who are using ICTs or, at best, simply pathologised the 'have nots' in terms of individual deficits. Yet developing a systematic and objective understanding of individuals' non-use of new technologies constitutes a major challenge for those seeking to map and understand the social realities of the 'information age'. The present paper, therefore, aims to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of people's non-use of new technologies: firstly, by considering established discourses of why individuals may be excluded or peripheral to ICT use; and then, via a critique of these positions, proposing an alternative framework of why people may not use ICT in their day-to-day lives based around individuals' 'reading' of technology. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={This paper makes a case for academic research and writing that looks beyond the learning potential of technology and, instead, seeks to develop social scientific accounts of the often compromised and constrained realities of education technology use 'on the ground'. The paper discusses how this 'critical' approach differs from the ways that educational technology scholarship has tended to be pursued to date. These differences include viewing technology as being socially constructed and negotiated rather than imbued with pre-determined characteristics; developing objective and realistic accounts of technology use in situ; and producing 'context rich' analyses of the social conflicts and politics that underpin the use of technology in educational settings. The paper concludes by encouraging academic researchers and writers to show greater interest in the issues of democracy and social justice that surround educational technology. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In particular the article explores how academic use of the internet is patterned by a range of potential influences such as students' wider internet use, access and expertise, their year of study, gender, age, ethnic and educational background. Analysis of these data suggests that students' academic internet use is most strongly patterned along the lines of gender and subject-specialism rather than other individual characteristics or differences in technology access or expertise.

This article therefore describes the development of an instrument for measuring the attitudes toward computers of students aged 16-19 years. Initial item selection produced a pilot scale consisting of 49 items which was administered to 266 students. Subsequent factor analysis revealed four structurally independent attitude constructs and justified retention of 21 of the original items. The revised scale was then administered to 87 Year 12-14 students for formal validation. The full instrument was found to have both a high internal reliability coefficient (0.90) and test-retest reliability (0.93), and significant construct validity (P<0.001). © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Although implicit within the notion of the 'digital divide' there have been surprisingly few empirical studies of those who make little or no use of information and communications technology (ICT). In particular, we have only a partial understanding of the social circumstances and detailed social patterning of the non-uptake and non-use of new technologies such as computers and the Internet. Are non-users of these technologies, as is widely assumed, falling into existing and deep-rooted patterns of social and economic inequalities? What are the individual motivations and consequences of not using ICT in the contemporary 'information society'? Based on household survey data collected from a systematic sample of 1001 adults in England and Wales alongside follow-up in-depth interviews with 100 of these respondents, this paper seeks to develop a detailed conceptual understanding of people's non-use of computers. Firstly, it explores in detail which individuals may be excluded from computer use to varying degrees. Secondly, it considers why these individuals are not using computers in their day-to-day lives. In doing so the paper identifies a hierarchy of non-use of ICT - highlighting the recurring structured nature of this non-engagement but also recognising the agency of individuals in not making use of technologies which may have a limited relevance, utility or even pleasure in the context of their everyday lives. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Digital technologies are now an integral aspect of the university student experience. As such, academic research has understandably focused on the potential of various digital technologies to enable, extend and even ‘enhance’ student learning. This paper offers an alternate perspective on these issues by exploring students’ actual experiences of digital technology during their academic studies–highlighting the aspects of digital technology use that students themselves see as particularly helpful and/or useful. Drawing on a survey of 1658 undergraduate students, the paper identifies 11 distinct digital ‘benefits'–ranging from flexibilities of time and place, ease of organizing and managing study tasks through to the ability to replay and revisit teaching materials, and learn in more visual forms. While these data confirm digital technologies as central to the ways in which students experience their studies, they also suggest that digital technologies are not ‘transforming’ the nature of university teaching and learning. As such, university educators perhaps need to temper enthusiasms for what might be achieved through technology-enabled learning and develop better understandings of the realities of students’ encounters with digital technology. © 2015 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

abstract={The generation and processing of data through digital technologies is an integral element of contemporary society, as reflected in recent debates over online data privacy, ‘Big Data’ and the rise of data mining and analytics in business, science and government. This paper outlines the significance of digital data within education, arguing for increased interest in the topic from educational researchers. Building on themes from the emerging sub-field of ‘digital sociology’, the paper outlines a number of ways in which digital data in education could be questioned along social lines. These include issues of data inequalities, the role of data in managerialist modes of organisation and control, the rise of so-called ‘dataveillance' and the reductionist nature of data-based representation. The paper concludes with a set of suggestions for future research and discussion, thus outlining the beginnings of a framework for the future critical study of digital data and education. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Whilst the copying, falsification and plagiarism of essays and assignments has long been a prevalent form of academic misconduct amongst undergraduate students, the increasing use of the internet in higher education has raised concern over enhanced levels of online plagiarism and new types of 'cyber-cheating'. Based on a self-report study of 1222 undergraduate students, this paper explores the nature and patterning of online plagiarism amongst students in UK higher educational institutions. The data find around three-fifths of students self-reporting at least a moderate level of internet-based plagiarism during the past 12 months, with significant differences in terms of gender, educational background and-most notably-subject discipline. Students' online plagiarism was also found to correlate strongly with their self-reported levels of offline plagiarism. The data therefore highlight the need to contextualize online plagiarism in relation to the wider 'life-world' of the contemporary university student and, in particular, the role of the internet in their everyday non-academic lives. The paper concludes by discussing how university authorities may go about addressing internet-based plagiarism in the contemporary university setting. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.},

Based on a household survey of 1001 adults with 100 in-depth follow-up interviews, the present article explores people's (non)use of the internet by asking: (1) who is (and who is not) using the internet in everyday life; (2) for what purposes people are using the internet and how are they developing their own constructions of the internet; and (3) how these understandings and uses of the internet are shaped by existing socioeconomic factors and circumstances. From this basis the article goes on to identify the key issues underlying adults' (non)use of the internet in terms of interest, relevance, mediation of significant others and the role of household dynamics. It also considers, from this basis, how non-users may be encouraged to make use of the internet.},

abstract={This book presents a wide-ranging and critical exploration of a topic that lies at the heart of contemporary education. The use of digital technology is now a key feature of schools and schooling around the world. Yet despite its prominence, technology use continues to be an area of education that rarely receives sustained critical attention and thought, especially from those people who are most involved and affected by it. Technology tends to be something that many teachers, learners, parents, policy-makers and even academics approach as a routine rather than reflective matter. Tackling the wider picture, addressing the social, cultural, economic, political and commercial aspects of schools and schooling in the digital age, this book offers to make sense of what happens, and what does not happen, when the digital and the educational come together in the guise of schools technology. In particular, the book examines contemporary schooling in terms of social justice, equality and participatory democracy. Seeking to re-politicise an increasingly depoliticised area of educational debate and analysis, setting out to challenge the many contradictions that characterise the field of education technology today, the author concludes by suggesting what forms schools and schooling in the digital age could, and should, take. This is the perfect volume for anyone interested in the application and use of technology in education, as well as the education policy and politics that surround it; many will also find its innovative proposals for technology use an inspiration for their own teaching and learning. © 2011 Neil Selwyn.

abstract={This paper considers the contribution of sociological theory to the academic study of young people, education and digital technology. First it discusses the shortcomings of the technological and socially determinist views of technology and education that prevail in current academic and policy discussions. Against this background the paper outlines the benefits of a number of different sociological perspectives on the social shaping of technology that, despite their popularity in other areas of science and technology studies, have been employed rarely in analyses of educational technology. In particular the paper outlines the provenance of theoretical approaches such as the social construction of technology, studies of domestication of digital technologies, feminist critical theory and the political economy of technology. Drawing on all these theoretical traditions the scene is then set for future empirical and theoretical examinations of young people's use of digital technology in formal and informal educational settings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In many industrialised countries information and communications technology (ICT) is now being seen as a ready means through which governments can address issues of social exclusion. Indeed, in the UK this perspective has been quickly translated into a multi-billion pound policy agenda aimed at using ICT for socially inclusive purposes. Yet, beyond rhetorical concerns over bridging the perceived 'digital divide' and alleviating disparities between the information 'rich' and 'poor', little critical consideration has been given to how technology is being used by governments to achieve socially inclusive aims. This paper therefore examines the UK government's ICT-based social policy drive through official documentation, policy statements and political discourse-considering the 'problems' that it sets out to address, the substance of the policies, and the perceived rationales and benefits for doing so. Having explored the official construction of these policies, the paper then examines how well founded this policy framework is in terms of achieving its stated aims of widening access to ICT and effectively facilitating 'social inclusion'. The paper concludes by developing a critical perspective of such ICT policies which reveals deeper economic rationales informing this ostensibly 'social' policy programme.},

In this paper, we investigate how one particular photo sharing application, Instagram, is used to communicate visitors' experiences while visiting a museum of natural history. Based on an analysis of 222 instagrams created in the museum, as well as 14 interviews with the visitors who created them, we unpack the compositional resources and concerns contributing to the creation of instagrams in this particular context. By re-categorizing and re-configuring the museum environment, instagrammers work to construct their own narratives from their visits. These findings are then used to discuss what emerging multimedia practices imply for the visitors' engagement with and documentation of museum exhibits. Drawing upon these practices, we discuss the connection between online social media dialogue and the museum site. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={For the past 20 years the discourse of the child as 'expert', or at least competent, computer user has proliferated in popular and political rhetoric in Western societies. From the early 1980s phenomena of the 'keyboard junkie' and computer hacker' to the 'cyberkids' and 'technotots' of the early 21st century, notions of omnipotent young computer users have been instrumental in shaping public expectations and fears concerning technology and society. Despite this importance, the role of the 'child computer user' in expediting societal acceptance of technology remains relatively unexamined. This article analyses the varying discursive constructions of 'child computer users' in the UK over the last 20 years through government rhetoric and policy making, IT industry marketing and media representation. In so doing the article shows how various discourses of the 'child computer user' have been integral elements in the framing and justification of prevailing notions of the 'information society' in the 'adult world' and, more importantly, continue to underpin the ongoing political-economic construction of the UK as a technological society. The article concludes by considering how the metaphoric use of the child acts to obscure the key actors and power relations behind the on-going construction of the information age.},

This paper therefore seeks to examine the nature and extent of students' domestic use of computers and the subsequent relationship with their use of IT in schools and colleges. Using a sample of 16-19-year-old students, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered to explore students' experiences of home computing. The results suggest that students using computers at home have significantly more positive attitudes toward using computers yet do not necessarily make more use of school or college-based IT; compensating for the inadequacies of educational IT with their use of computers at home. Nevertheless access to, and benefits gained from, home computers were found to differ significantly according to students' gender. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It follows that many educational technologists are understandably ill-disposed towards anyone whose actions disrupt their own personal faith and optimism. Indeed, educational technology could be seen as a field that requires its participants to maintain a long-term collective belief that the project will be seen through to an ultimately successful conclusion. When seen in this light, it could be reasoned that pessimism is a rewarding and heartening position from which to approach education and technology. A pessimistic approach would also lead the field to be more modest in its intentions and in its interventions.},

abstract={Digital Technology and the Contemporary University examines the often messy realities of higher education in the ‘digital age’. Drawing on a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives, the book explores the intimate links between digital technology and wider shifts within contemporary higher education - not least the continued rise of the managerialist ‘bureaucratic’ university. It highlights the ways that these new trends can be challenged, and possibly changed altogether. Addressing a persistent gap in higher education and educational technology research, where digital technology is rarely subject to an appropriately critical approach, Degrees of Digitization offers an alternative reading of the social, political, economic and cultural issues surrounding universities and technology. The book highlights emerging themes that are beginning to be recognised and discussed in academia, but as yet have not been explored thoroughly. Over the course of eight wide-ranging chapters the book addresses issues such as: • The role of digital technology in university reform; • Digital technologies and the organisation of universities; • Digital technology and the working lives of university staff; • Digital technology and the ‘student experience’; • Reimagining the place of digital technology within the contemporary university. This book will be of great interest to all students, academic researchers and writers working in the areas of education studies and/or educational technology, as well as being essential reading for anyone working in the areas of higher education research and digital media research. © 2014 N.

abstract={As information and communications technology (ICT) becomes more commonplace in educational settings the use of computer mediated communication (CMC) between teachers is increasingly being seen as a valid form of professional dialogue and support. Indeed, the promotion of online discussion groups as "virtual meeting places" for teachers has formed a central part of the UK government's £1 billion drive to make ICT use part of day-to-day practice in British schools. However, amidst the enthusiasm for creating "virtual communities" of teachers, little is known about how educational professionals are using such resources in practice. To this end the present paper reports on a study of UK teachers' use of an established online discussion group over a two-year period. It shows that, although the online forum was widely being used both as an information and empathetic exchange resource, many of the claims of establishing collectively focused virtual communities of teachers remain exaggerated as the forum was limited by a number of caveats associated with CMC groups in general.

Analysis of the data shows pupils' engagements with ICTs to be often perfunctory and unspectacular, especially within the school setting, where the influence of year group and school attended are prominent. Whilst the majority of children felt that ICT use led to gains in learning, the paper discusses how there was a strong sense of educational uses of ICTs being constrained by the nature of the schools within which 'educational' use was largely framed and often situated. The paper concludes by suggesting possible changes to ICT provision in primary schools, most notably relaxing school restrictions regarding Internet access and developing meaningful dialogues with pupils about future forms of educational ICT use. © 2008 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency.},

abstract={Educational commentators have long feared a 'digital disconnection' between emerging generations of technology-rich students accustomed to high levels of Internet use and their technology-poor schools. Yet few studies have empirically examined the existence and potential implications of such a disconnect from the students' perspective. The present paper replicates Levin and Arafeh's (2002) US study which solicited online stories from students detailing how they used the Internet for school. Responses from 84 UK secondary school students show that just over half felt restricted in their Internet use at school. Unlike the original US study, the primary disconnect between UK Internet-using students and their schools was not one of physical access but the restriction of their Internet use through school rules and content filters, firewalls and other technologies of control. Whilst some students displayed frustration and disenchantment, most gave measured and sometimes sympathetic views of their schools' less-than-perfect information technology provision. As such, many of our students were well aware of a digital disconnect but displayed a pragmatic acceptance rather than the outright alienation from school that some commentators would suggest.},

abstract={This engaging book sheds light on the ways in which adults in the twenty-first century interact with technology in different learning environments. Based on one of the first large-scale academic research projects in this area, the authors present their findings and offer practical recommendations for the use of new technology in a learning society. They invite debate on: Why ICTs are believed to be capable of affecting positive change in adult learning. The drawbacks and limits of ICT in adult education. What makes a lifelong learner. The wider social, economic, cultural and political realities of the information age and the learning society. Adult Learning addresses key questions and provides a sound empirical foundation to the existing debate, highlighting the complex realities of the learning society and e-learning rhetoric. It tells the story of those who are excluded from the learning society, and offers a set of strong recommendations for practitioners, policy-makers, and politicians, as well as researchers and students. © 2006 Neil Selwyn, Stephen Gorard and John Furlong.

abstract={The study aimed to explore how adolescents communicate food images in a widely used social media image-sharing application. We examined how and in what context food was presented and the type of food items that were frequently portrayed by following a youth related hashtag on Instagram. The hashtag #14år ("14 years") was used to find adolescent users on Instagram: these users public photo streams were then searched for food items they had shared with others. Food items were identified and categorized based on type of food and how the food items were presented. Most of the adolescent users (85%) shared images containing food items. A majority of the images (67.7%) depicted foods high in calories but low in nutrients. Almost half of these images were arranged as a still life with food brand names clearly exposed. Many of these images were influenced by major food marketing campaigns. Fruits and vegetables occurred in 21.8% of all images. This food group was frequently portrayed zoomed in with focus solely on the food, with a hashtag or caption expressing palatability. These images were often presented in the style of a cook book. Food was thus presented in varied ways. Adolescents themselves produced images copying food advertisements. This has clear health promotion implications since it becomes more challenging to monitor and tackle young people's exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods in these popular online networks because images are part of a lifestyle that the young people want to promote. Shared images contain personal recommendations, which mean that they may have a more powerful effect than commercial advertising. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Although considerable academic interest has focused on serious cyber-crimes, more commonplace Internet misuses (e.g., misrepresentation of self, unauthorized downloading, Internet pornography, online plagiarism, and other "cyber-cheating") have received less attention. Although these transgressions are of minor legal importance, they merit closer academic scrutiny. Based on a self-report study of 1,222 U.K. undergraduate students, this article explores the prevalence, nature, and underpinning facilitators of five examples of Internet-based misbehavior. Although more than 90% of respondents self-reported online misbehavior during the past 12 months, significant differences are evident in gender, Internet expertise, and, to a lesser extent, age. Although respondents portrayed the Internet as a more conducive environment for misbehavior, the survey data report a strong correlation between respondents' propensity to misbehave in online and offline contexts. These data highlight the need to contextualize cyber-deviance in relation to the offline "life world" of the Internet user and the Internet's wider role in everyday life. © 2008 Sage Publications.},

The present study is based on a survey of 406 undergraduate students aged between 18 and 39 years conducted to examine whether different aspects of information and communication technology (ICT) use continue to be seen in particularly gendered terms by young adults and what reasons could be identified for any gender stereotyping. Analysis of the survey data show how issues of masculinity and femininity continue to be an important-if perhaps more subtle-influence on how young people perceive ICTs in contemporary society. In all, the findings confirm the continuing persistence of gender stereotypes as a frame of reference for ICTs. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Mobile technologies such as palmtop computers and mobile telephones represent a new breed of technological innovation - offering easier and quicker access to information and communication on an 'anytime, anywhere' basis. These networks are seen to lead to temporal and spatial re-definitions of young people's lines, with notions of time and space centred around the individual rather than shared societal norms or expectations. Such changes are now prompting some educationalists to predict that mobile technologies will radically change students, and therefore the nature of schools and schooling. Set against a lack of considered academic debate, the present paper offers a detailed consideration of the theoretical and practical implications of mobile technologies such as phones and handheld computers on schools and schooling by contrasting the fixed' nature of schools against 'mobile' technologies' freeing up of the key symbolic forms of power of information and communication. After considering the strengths and limitations of both these viewpoints, this paper then outlines a framework for future research and discussion in this area.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of multi-variate analyses of the social, economic and educational characteristics associated with reporting both access to the Internet and using the Internet for four key purposes: banking and finance, purchasing goods or services, accessing government or official services and looking for work or employment. The research was conducted using nationally representative, individual-level, repeated cross-sectional data (n = 47,001) collected in annual surveys in the UK between 2002 and 2010. The results of the analyses show that although Internet access and use have increased over the period studied, both continue to be structured according to occupational class, educational background and, to some extent, age. The sex and ethnicity of respondents had little impact on the probability of reporting Internet access and were only strongly related to using the Internet for purchasing goods or services. Additionally, the presence of children in a household was unimportant in relation to both Internet access or use. While the findings differ slightly from previous studies they confirm that both Internet access and use remain structured along socio-economic and educational lines that work against already disadvantaged groups. This has remained the case in the UK throughout the 2000s despite considerable technological change and policy interventions specifically targeting marginalized sections of society. The paper concludes that policy interventions aimed at both increasing and widening Internet access and use will be ineffective unless the social, rather than technological, basis of inequalities in access and use are recognized. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={One notable 'disruptive' impact of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has been an increased public discussion of online education. While much debate over the potential and challenges of MOOCs has taken place online confined largely to niche communities of practitioners and advocates, the rise of corporate 'xMOOC' ventures such as Coursera, edX and Udacity has prompted popular mass media interest at levels not seen with previous educational innovations. This article addresses this important societal outcome of the recent emergence of MOOCs as an educational form by examining the popular discursive construction of MOOCs over the past 24 months within mainstream news media sources in United States, Australia and the UK. In particular, we provide a critical account of what has been an important phase in the history of educational technology-detailing a period when popular discussion of MOOCs has far outweighed actual use/participation. We argue that a critical analysis of MOOC discourse throughout the past two years highlights broader societal struggles over education and digital technology-capturing a significant moment before these debates subside with the anticipated normalization and assimilation of MOOCs into educational practice. This analysis also sheds light on the influences underpinning how many people perceive MOOCs thereby leading to a better understanding of acceptance/adoption and rejection/resistance amongst various professional and popular publics. © Bulfin, Pangrazio, Selwyn.},

These data reveal that although the vast majority of children are making some use of computers in school, patterns of sustained and varied engagement with ICT are rare; with educational use of computers curtailed by a variety of classroom factors. Moreover, although many children could be considered to be sophisticated and knowledgeable consumers of ICT, their outside-of-school access to technology is varied. The findings raise questions about the nature of ICT use in primary classrooms and the need to ensure meaningful and regular access to technology in school for all children.},

abstract={Background: Virtual microscopy is being introduced in medical education as an approach for learning how to interpret information in microscopic specimens. It is, however, far from evident how to incorporate its use into existing teaching practice. The aim of the study was to explore the consequences of introducing virtual microscopy tasks into an undergraduate pathology course in an attempt to render the instruction more process-oriented. The research questions were: 1) How is virtual microscopy perceived by students? 2) Does work on virtual microscopy tasks contribute to improvement in performance in microscopic pathology in comparison with attending assistant-led demonstrations only?Method: During a one-week period, an experimental group completed three sets of virtual microscopy homework assignments in addition to attending demonstrations. A control group attended the demonstrations only. Performance in microscopic pathology was measured by a pre-test and a post-test. Student perceptions of regular instruction and virtual microscopy were collected one month later by administering the Inventory of Intrinsic Motivation and open-ended questions.Results: The students voiced an appreciation for virtual microscopy for the purposes of the course and for self-study. As for learning gains, the results indicated that learning was speeded up in a subgroup of students consisting of conscientious high achievers.Conclusions: The enriched instruction model may be suited as such for elective courses following the basic course. However, the instructional model needs further development to be suited for basic courses. © 2011 Helle et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Information and communications technology (ICT) has fast become the rhetorical foundation of the UK government's attempts to transform adult education radically and to establish a 'learning society'. Central to this rhetoric are a series of largely untested assumptions about the potential of ICT to increase and widen levels of educational participation to include those groups of learners who have previously been excluded. With this in mind, the present paper contrasts recent government rhetoric concerning post-compulsory 'e-learning' with an analysis of data from the 2002 National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) survey of 5,885 households. With these data suggesting that access to ICT does not, in itself, make people any more likely to participate in education and (re)engage with learning, the paper concludes by considering how ICT might be more realistically re-approached by the educational and political communities.},

abstract={The creation of technologically-based ‘virtual education’ has been portrayed as a means of widening access to learning opportunities for those currently excluded from participation in lifelong education and training. Now in the UK these claims are being operationalized under the ‘University for Industry’ initiative and associated Virtual College programmes all of which aim to make real the concept of Britain as a ‘learning society’ for all with an emphasis on reaching those traditionally seen as non-participants in learning. This paper examines these claims in the light of current knowledge about the characteristics of non-participants in lifelong learning and the barriers that they face. It is suggested that the application of ‘technological fixes’ to underlying socio-economic determinants of participation will solve some problems, create others, and leave many unaffected. In this way the paper argues for independent research on the impact of the ‘virtual college’ movement, and begins to outline the form such research could take. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Despite the hyperbole that has continually surrounded the area of educational computing, for the last 20 years the computer has noticeably failed to permeate the school setting. This has traditionally been attributed to a failure of educational practice to adapt to, and provide for, the educational ‘IT revolution’. However, this article argues that a wider critique of educational computing should be adopted if-we are to really understand the apparent failure of computers to be integrated into the compulsory educational setting. By examining how educational computing has been, and continues to be, constructed in both educational policy and discourse, the article considers how this ‘writing’ of educational computing is fundamentally at odds with the structure of the school organisation it is meant to merge with. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Although we now know much about children's use of information and communications technologies, researchers have yet to consider adequately the roles that children play in shaping adults' computer use. Via household survey data from a randomised sample of 1,001 adults and in-depth interview data from 100 of these initial respondents, this paper explores the meditating roles of children in: the purchasing/acquisition of computers by adults; adults' access to computers; the level and nature of adults' use (and non-use) of computers; how adults learn to use computers; and how adults are supported when using computers. The paper concludes that while children play a variety of roles in adults' (non)adoption and (non)use of computers this influence is often tempered by a range of other factors and, indeed, should not be overstated. For example, while children appear to be a significant “official” factor in parents' and grandparents' adoption of computers they were rarely the sole reason for adults investing time and money in ICT – with a range of other self-orientated reasons usually in attendance. In terms of adults' access to and use of ICT, the demands of children to use computers were a mitigating but not always dominant factor to be considered by parents. Similarly, children appear to play a peripheral role in supporting adults' use of ICT. The paper concludes by considering how the role of children in adults' use of ICT would appear to be often more symbolic than practical;, e.g. as an official justification for buying/adopting a computer rather than as a strong and sustained guiding force. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={The use of information technology in education is now a political orthodoxy, seen by many politicians and educators as a ready means of widening participation to those social groups traditionally excluded from learning. However, the role of technology in overcoming social exclusion in education and lifetime learning practices has often failed to be objectively discussed, with a tendency for many educationalists to adopt either overtly optimistic or pessimistic positions. From this background, the present article objectively examines both current patterns of exclusion from education and technology alongside the range of ongoing policies and initiatives established in the United States concerned with technology and education. Moreover, based on a range of North American and European research literature concerned with participation in education, the article then discusses the issues and problems faced by U. S. educationalists and policy makers in proactively using technology as a means of reducing social exclusion in lifelong education.},

With initial fears over its detrimental influence on scholarship and study habits now subsiding, this paper investigates what part Wikipedia plays in the academic lives of undergraduate students. The paper draws upon survey data gathered from students across two universities in Australia (n = 1658), alongside follow-up group interview data from a subsample of 35 students. Analysis of this data suggests that Wikipedia is now an embedded feature of most students' study, although to a lesser extent than other online information sources such as YouTube and Facebook. For the most part, Wikipedia was described as an introductory and/or supplementary source of information - providing initial orientation and occasional clarification on study topics. While 87.5% of students reported using Wikipedia, it was seen to be of limited usefulness when compared with university-provided library resources, e-books, learning management systems, lecture recordings and academic literature databases. These findings were notably patterned in terms of students' gender, year of study, first language spoken and subject of study. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Following a wide-ranging interrogation of the ideological dimensions of educational technology, this book examines in detail specific types of digital technology in use in education today, including virtual education, ‘open’ courses, digital games, and social media. It then concludes with specific recommendations for fairer forms of educational technology. An ideal read for anyone interested in the fast-changing nature of contemporary education, Distrusting Educational Technology comprises an ambitious and much-needed critique.
Distrusting Educational Technology critically explores the optimistic consensus that has arisen around the use of digital technology in education. Drawing on a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives, this book shows how apparently neutral forms of educational technology have actually served to align educational provision and practices with neo-liberal values, thereby eroding the nature of education as a public good and moving it instead toward the individualistic tendencies of twenty-first century capitalism. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

As such, academic research has tended to concentrate on the potential of digital technologies to support, extend and even ‘enhance’ student learning. This paper, in contrast, explores the rather more messy realities of students’ engagements with digital technology. In particular, it focuses on the aspects of digital technology use that students see as notably unhelpful. Drawing on a survey of 1658 undergraduate students from two Australian universities, the paper highlights four distinct types of digital ‘downside’. These range from low-level annoyances and interruptions, to ways in which digital technologies are seen to diminish students’ scholarship and study. Against this background, the paper considers how discussions of digital technology might better balance enthusiasms for what we know might be achieved through technology-enabled learning, with the often unsatisfactory realities of students’ encounters with digital technology. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper is based on 1001 home-based interviews with UK adults. It describes their varying patterns of participation in lifelong learning and their use of technology for learning and leisure. It finds that 37% of all adults report no further education of any kind after reaching compulsory school leaving age. This proportion declines with each age cohort, but is largely replaced by a pattern of lengthening initial education and still reporting no later education. These patterns of participation are predictable to a large extent from regression analysis using a life-order model of determining variables - all of which are set very early in life. This suggests that universal theories to describe participation, such as human capital theory, are incorrect in several respects. Where individuals create, for themselves and through their early experiences, a 'learner identity' inimicable to further study, then the prospect of learning can become a burden rather than an investment for them. This has implications for the now widespread and extensively funded notion of overcoming barriers to access via technology.},

abstract={The popular stereotype of the frequent computer user persists to be one of a male, socially inadequate and isolated individual - a perception which has been found to cause many students to avoid coming into contact with information and communications technology (ICT), both inside and outside of school. This article reports on a study examining the gender and social competency of both frequent and infrequent computer-using students in Year 12 (n = 117). The results suggest that students who are highly oriented toward ICT are just as likely to be female as they are male and are no less sociable, popular, or self-assured than their non-ICT using peers. These data are then contrasted with interview data from the "high" and "low" using students which suggest that negative stereotyping of the computer-using student persists - although primarily among students not engaging with ICT in school. The article postulates that the vast increases in ICT use in schools over the last ten years has created a more accessible "computer culture" to which increasing numbers of students are now subscribing; although teachers need to be aware of the persistence of the male, anti-social stereotype within elements of the student body.},

Against this fast-changing background, the response of many countries has been to develop policies aimed at creating national information infrastructures (NII) - often with educational networking initiatives as an integral or pioneering element. Given the emerging global policyscape (Ball 1999) towards creating educational information networks this paper presents a comparative analysis of policy-making across Europe, East Asia and the USA. In analysing education networking in seven case-study countries, the paper emphasizes a political economy perspective; thus focusing attention on the role of the state and the varying relationship between education, economy and society. Having explored the varying motivations and objectives behind countries' education networking programmes the paper concludes by outlining an educational research agenda for future examination of NII policies as they continue to be implemented in developed nations over the next decade. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Over the last two decades there have been numerous studies in a variety of countries examining students' attitudes towards computers, ranging from pre-school to postgraduate levels of education. Despite a plethora of international attitudinal research there has, however, been a conspicuous avoidance of the 16-19 educational setting (i.e. Grades 12-14). From this background the present study examined the attitudes towards computers of a sample of 983 students from nine school sixth-form and college based institutions in South Wales. Although students' attitudes towards IT were found to be influenced by a range of individually and educationally based factors, multivariate analysis showed that attitudes were primarily influenced by the subject area and qualification pathway students were following as well as their access to a home computer. Contrary to previous research, gender was found to only exert a lesser influence on students' attitudes. Furthermore, factors such as the educational institution attended and students' year group were not found to affect attitudes towards computers.

abstract={Objectives There has been long-standing controversy regarding aptitude testing and selection for medical education. Visual perception is considered particularly important for detecting signs of disease as part of diagnostic procedures in, for example, microscopic pathology, radiology and dermatology and as a component of perceptual motor skills in medical procedures such as surgery. In 1968 the Perceptual Ability Test (PAT) was introduced in dental education. The aim of the present pilot study was to explore possible predictors of performance in diagnostic classification based on microscopic observation in the context of an undergraduate pathology course. Methods A pre- and post-test of diagnostic classification performance, test of visual perceptual skill (Test of Visual Perceptual Skills, 3rd edition [TVPS-3]) and a self-report instrument of personality (Big Five Personality Inventory) were administered. In addition, data on academic performance (performance in histology and cell biology, a compulsory course taken the previous year, in addition to performance on the microscopy examination and final examination) were collected. Results The results indicated that one personality factor (Conscientiousness) and one element of visual perceptual ability (spatial relationship awareness) predicted performance on the pre-test. The only factor to predict performance on the post-test was performance on the pre-test. Similarly, the microscopy examination score was predicted by the pre-test score, in addition to the histology and cell biology grade. The course examination score was predicted by two personality factors (Conscientiousness and lack of Openness) and the histology and cell biology grade. Conclusions Visual spatial ability may be related to performance in the initial phase of training in microscopic pathology. However, from a practical point of view, medical students are able to learn basic microscopic pathology using worked-out examples, independently of measures of personality or visual perceptual ability. This finding should reassure students about their abilities to improve with training independently of their scores on tests on basic abilities and personality. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2010.},

abstract={The notion of the computer as an inherently 'educational' machine has been a powerful influence on both the conceptualisation and consumption of information technology in the UK over the past 20 years. Most recently, a belief in the teaching and learning capabilities of the computer underpinned much of New Labour's policy agenda during their first term of office, most notably in the form of the £1.6 billion 'National Grid for Learning' initiative. Yet all too often, the high-profile social shaping of computing as 'educational' has been more grounded in rhetoric than in reality, with the 'hype' of the educational computer noticeably at odds with the actual impact of computing technologies in schools and at home. From this background, the present paper explores how the computer became to be so strongly 'configured' as educational during its integration into mainstream British society and culture. In so doing, the paper examines the various actors and routes of transmitting information that were involved in the construction of the computer as an educational machine and, as a result, goes on to consider the underlying motivations behind this process. In asking these questions, the paper focuses on the period 1979-89 as marking the birth of mainstream educational computing in the UK, and therefore identifies and discusses the prevailing influences of the incumbent Conservative government, the burgeoning home computer industry as well as the print and broadcast media as powerful actors in the formative discursive shaping of 'educational' computing. Having mapped out these shaping forces, the paper concludes by considering the implications of the on-going trend towards the educational mythologising of information technology in British society.},

A questionnaire was designed to measure respondent's gendered perceptions of 26 different features of computers and computer-based applications on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from feminine to masculine with a neutral midpoint for neither masculine nor feminine. The questionnaire was administered to 406 undergraduate students following humanities, social sciences, business and engineering courses in two UK universities during 2005-06 academic year. Computer gaming was rated as the most masculine aspect of computers and online banking, online auctions, and downloading music came after that. Participants were invited through an open-ended item to expand upon the reasoning behind their responses. It was argued that studying online was considered a feminine activity because the girls want to study as compared to boys.},

abstract={This article uses the reports from 1,001 home-based interviews, with adults living in the United Kingdom, to describe their varying patterns of participation in lifelong, learning. It finds that 37% of all adults report no further education or training of any kind after reaching compulsory school-leaving age. This proportion declines in each age cohort but is largely replaced by a pattern of lengthening initial education and still reporting no further education or training of any kind after leaving. The actual patterns of participation are predictable to a large extent from regression analysis using a life order model of determining variables. The key variables are age, ethnicity, sex, family background, and initial schooling, all of which are set very early in life. This suggests that universal theories to describe participation, such as simple human capital theory, are incorrect in several respects. Where individuals create, for themselves and through their early experiences, a "learner identity" inimical to further study, then the prospect of learning can become a burden rather than an investment. This has implications for the notion of overcoming barriers to access, such as those involving technology. Copyright © by Teachers College, Columbia University.},

abstract={The ability to use a computer is assumed to be a cornerstone of effective citizenship in the Information Age, with a range of initiatives and educational provisions being introduced to encourage people to become competent with information technology (IT). Despite such provision, levels of computer use and competence have been found to vary widely throughout the general population, and we know little of how different ways of learning to use computers contribute to people's eventual use of IT. Based on data from in-depth interviews with 100 adults in the United Kingdom, this article examines the range and social stratification of formal and informal learning about computers that is taking place, suggesting that formal computer instruction orientated toward the general public may inadvertently widen the digital knowledge gap. In particular, the data highlight the importance of informal learning about IT and of encouraging such learning, especially in the home.},

abstract={This structured review examined (academic) publications on flipped or inverted classrooms based on all Scopus database (n = 530) references available until mid-June 2016. The flipped or inverted classroom approach has gained widespread attention during the latest decade and is based on the idea of improving student learning by prepared self-studies via technology-based resources (‘flips’) followed by high-quality, in-class teaching and learning activities. However, only a few attempts have been made to review the knowledge of the field of interest more systematically. This article seeks to address this problem and investigates what constitutes the research on flipped classrooms and, in particular, to examine the knowledge contributions with the field so far in relation to the wider research topic of educational technology. This review found that the current state of flipped classrooms as a field of interest is growing fast, with a slight conference preference and a focus on higher education and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) area contributions, with the US as the predominant geographical context. It is concluded that studies on flipped classrooms are dominated by studies in higher education sector and are relatively local in character. The research tends not to interact beyond the two clusters of general education/educational technology and subject-specific areas. This implies that knowledge contributions related to the flipped classroom approach are relatively siloed and fragmented and have yet to stabilise. Academically and socially, the research is quite scattered, and only local evidence and experiences are available. The knowledge contributions within this field of interest seem to be anecdotal rather than systematically researched. To a large extent, the research lacks anchoring in, for example, learning theory or instructional design known from educational technology traditions and which would have helped much of the flipped classroom research to examine aspects of the flipped classroom approach more fully. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Schools have long made use of digital technologies to support the co-ordination of management and administrative processes - not least 'management information systems', 'virtual learning environments' and other 'institutional technologies'. The last five years have seen the convergence of these technologies into integrated rather than separate systems - thereby allowing institutionally-related data, resources and other services to be accessed and used by school leaders, administrators, teachers, students and parents. Many commentators see the supposedly 'open' nature of these integrated systems as somehow democratising and decentralising the organisation of schools. However, this paper offers a detailed account of how the social relations of schools and schooling shape and bound the use of institutional technologies. Drawing on interview data from twelve 'early adopting' schools in England, the paper discusses how the implementation of integrated institutional technology systems is shaped by a set of organisational, bureaucratic and disciplinary concerns. In particular, the paper illustrates how these technologies strengthen existing 'top down' patterns of social power and control through a series of data-driven processes. The paper therefore considers how the systems are used to reinforce a wider 'conservative modernisation' of schools - intensifying the managerial control of curricula, the standardisation of labour processes and the accountability of educational practices. © 2011 Copyright University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been a prominent topic of recent educational discussion and debate. MOOCs are, in essence, university-affiliated courses offered to large groups of online learners for little or no cost and are seen by many as a bellwether for change and reform across higher education systems. This study uses content and discourse analysis methods to examine how understandings of MOOC-related 'change' were presented in US, UK and Australian newspapers. Drawing on detailed analysis of 457 newspaper articles published between 2011 and 2013, the findings point to a predominant portrayal of MOOCs in relation to the massification, marketization and monetization of higher education, rather than engaging in debate of either 'technological' or 'educational' issues such as online learning and pedagogy, instructional design or student experience. The article then considers the reasons underpinning this restricted framing of what many commentators have touted as a radical educational form-not least the apparently close association between MOOCs and the economics of higher education. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The adoption of virtual microscopy at the University of Turku, Finland, created a unique real-world laboratory for exploring ways of reforming the learning environment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the students' reactions and the impact of a set of measures designed to boost an experimental group's understanding of abnormal histology through an emphasis on knowledge of normal cells and tissues. The set of measures included (1) digital resources to review normal structures and an entrance examination for enforcement, (2) digital course slides highlighting normal and abnormal tissues, and (3) self-diagnostic quizzes. The performance of historical controls was used as a baseline, as previous students had never been exposed to the above-mentioned measures. The students' understanding of normal histology was assessed in the beginning of the module to determine the impact of the first set of measures, whereas that of abnormal histology was assessed at the end of the module to determine the impact of the whole set of measures. The students' reactions to the instructional measures were assessed by course evaluation data. Additionally, four students were interviewed. Results confirmed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the historical controls in understanding normal histology. The students held favorable opinions on the idea of emphasizing normal structures. However, with regards to abnormal histology, the historical controls outperformed the experimental group. In conclusion, allowing students access to high-quality digitized materials and boosting prerequisite skills are clearly not sufficient to boost final competence. Instead, the solution may lie in making students externally accountable for their learning throughout their training. Anat Sci Educ 6: 73-80. © 2012 American Association of Anatomists.},

abstract={This study investigates teachers’ attitudes to and beliefs about using ICT in education and proposes a model of how different variables are related to teachers’ use of ICT in classrooms. The model suggests that positive attitudes related specifically to ICT as a useful tool for teaching and learning and a strong sense of self-efficacy in using computers in education seem to influence the use of ICT the most. It is also suggested that positive attitudes to ICT generally do not seem to contribute very much to teachers’ use of ICT in classrooms. This is a surprising finding. The distinction between the importance of specific and general attitudes to ICT use and the emphasis on self-efficacy contributes to contemporary research. Self-efficacy and attitudes are suggested to be mutually related to ICT use. © 2012, © 2012 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Drawing on a wealth of theoretical and empirical work, Education in a Digital Worldtackles a number of pressing questions, such as, how are global trends in educational technology refracted through national policies and processes? How exactly are educational technologies linked to issues of global economics and the fortunes of national and international economies? To what extent are digital technologies implicated in the commercialisation, marketization and commodification of education? These questions, and others, are addressed throughout eight wide-ranging chapters, which consider topics such as the national policy strategies of countries across North and South America, Europe and East Asia, the educational technology portfolios of international organizations such as the United Nations and Microsoft, as well as the role of education and technology in international development and the on-going efforts to provide one laptop per child across low-income regions and countries. Through these examples Selwyn develops a detailed analysis of education, technology and globalisation, drawing together arguments and debates from various academic perspectives. Written in a detailed but accessible manner, this is an essential book for anyone wishing to gain a better understanding of the role of education and technology in contemporary globalised society. © Taylor & Francis All rights reserved.},

abstract={Although the National Targets for Education and Training in England and Wales include indicators for lifelong learning, and the progress towards the targets set for these indicators has been lauded by politicians and other observers, much of this apparent progress is actually accounted for by changes in these same indicators at Foundation level. However, once the 'conveyor belt effect' of passing increasingly qualified 16-18 year-olds into the working-age population instead of less qualified 60 and 65 year-olds, is taken into account, then progress in qualifying those of working-age is much less. In fact, there is then very limited evidence that Lifelong Learning targets have had any impact at all. Certainly work-based training has not increased, and may even have declined over the last decade, while some socio-economic inequalities in adult participation in education and training have worsened. The paper examines this apparent weakness for the current approach and its implications for the measurement of progress, in the light of a research review carried out for the National Assembly of Wales. It therefore asks increasingly important questions about targets, such as what they are for, and whether those who set and monitor them are aware of their deficiencies and artificialities.},

From this basis, the present paper takes an empirical perspective in students' use of the Internet, via focus group interviews with 77 students in two UK universities, and explores the factors underlying their use (and non-use) of the Internet in university. Four crucial themes were identified, namely: (i) the ways in which students were introduced to using the Internet; (ii) operational problems encountered when using the Internet as an information resource; (iii) treatment of information retrieved from the Internet; (iv) the social element of learning in on-line environments. These factors are examined in detail and discussed in relation to the future presentation and organisation of students' Internet use in university settings. Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2000.},

abstract={The integral place of information and communications technology (ICT) in UK lifelong education has been established by a series of technology-based initiatives introduced by the New Labour government since 1997. Initiatives such as the University for Industry, learndirect, People's Network and National Grid for Learning are being implemented as part of a coherent lifelong education policy-agenda fundamentally based upon the use of ICT. Yet, beneath the political enthusiasm for technology-based education, the role of ICT in lifelong learning remains largely unexamined and unproblematized, with many policy-makers and educationalists content to view technology as providing a ‘technical fix’ for many of education's problems. From this background, the present paper provides a critical perspective on the technological foundations of the UK government's lifelong education agenda. In particular, it examines the nature and form of the policies that have been introduced and then contrasts them with the rhetorical claims that are being made by government and other official actors. In this way the paper discusses how such policies continue to be shaped within a restrictive technocratic and determinist discourse of the ‘technical fix’, thus conforming to traditional narratives of society and technology. The paper then goes on to explore how such construction juxtaposes social and economic elements of the policy-drive and threatens, ultimately, to restrict the eventual educational effectiveness of these ‘new’ lifelong learning initiatives. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Drawing upon an empirical study of two Australian secondary schools, this paper explores the different forms of data-based governance that are being enacted by school leaders, managers, administrators and teachers. These findings illustrate a range of routinized ways in which digital data is being used within schools as a means of accountability. Alongside data regimes associated with the ‘governing by numbers’ enforced by state and federal governments, are smaller-scale accountability procedures and practices initiated ‘in-house’ by school managers and/or teaching staff. While digital technologies are clearly reinforcing wider trends in educational managerialism, the paper also considers the subtle ways that local enactments of such governance are shaped by schools’ relatively unsophisticated data processing technologies and techniques. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

While hardly a technology expert, his work has shown an acute awareness of the significance of computers, the internet and mobile telephony in making sociological sense of education. This paper contrasts the limited visibility of such issues within the sociology of education over the past 30 years with how the present situation appears to be improving during the 2010s. The paper also identifies opportunities for future work that engages more in the co-production, development and design of new forms of educational technology. As such it is concluded that a future sociology of education and technology needs to be developed that acts not only against, but also in and beyond, the dominant field of education technology. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper examines the experiences and understandings of primary (K6) school pupils with regards to managing issues of risk and safety during their everyday use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The paper is based on survey and interview data with pupils aged 7 to 11 years old in five English primary schools (n∈=∈612). Analysis of these data shows that whilst most pupils recognised a general need to be mindful of ICT-related risks and dangers, their actual experiences of risk tended to be described in terms of operational problems encountered when using ICTs. Conversely, pupils' understandings of potential risk were often based upon exaggerated fears deriving from a number of moral panics relating to child safety. These data suggest that official notions of 'e-safety' remain abstract and poorly understood concepts for many children. In considering what implications these data have for the ongoing 'e-safety' agenda in UK schools the paper concludes by suggesting three possible areas of change: (1) re-orientating the topic and tone of the official discourses surrounding e-safety; (2) increasing pedagogical interventions in primary schools aiming at enhancing pupils' critical literacy skills; and (3) establishing a meaningful and sustained dialogue between pupils, teachers and parents about safety and risk when using ICTs. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

At 'half-term', what are the prospects for a 'pass' in this course? Using data from a new National Institute of Adult Continuing Education survey of adult participation in learning, and early results from participant observation of the setting up of a 'virtual college', as well as published findings from pilot studies for the University for Industry, this article considers the challenges facing the Government in widening participation through the use of digital technology. The 'problem', of widening access to learning opportunities for all, is not a new one, and it is unlikely to be one with a simple technical fix. The conclusion drawn here is that the emerging use of digital technology is likely to replicate existing inequalities in access to learning. Despite the fine efforts of those involved, and some ingenious technical and distributional suggestions, the recommendation must therefore be that we all try harder.},

abstract={Although the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) has been thrust upon the education sector amidst a blaze of publicity, the 'physical' construction of the Grid promises to be a slow process, with the government giving an optimistic target of 3 years before the initiative will approach full operation. In the meantime, a major initial step in the construction of the NGfL has been the marketing of the Grid to an educational sector historically resistant and sceptical towards Information and Communications Technology. This paper therefore explores the emerging discourse of the NGfL by examining seven examples of marketing and promotional material produced by industry and the government. From these texts, we can therefore gain a sense of how the NGfL is beginning to be shaped at a macro level by its key actors. After presenting the seven texts, the paper explores the predominant themes underlying this discursive construction and highlights an underlying deterministic positioning of the Learning Grid. The paper concludes by considering the limitations of shaping the Learning Grid in this manner and argues for an alternative perspective in future research.},

The review shows that while formally-organized and informally-developed communities address different needs amongst teachers and support different outcomes, they also share several common characteristics. Indeed, regardless of type, online communities can be a valuable means of developing supportive and collegial professional practices. That said, more evidence is required on the specific collaborative merits of teachers’ online interactions. © 2018},

abstract={The generation, processing and circulation of data in digital form is now an integral aspect of contemporary schooling. Based upon empirical study of two secondary school settings in Australia, this paper considers the different forms of digitally-based 'data work' engaged in by school leaders, managers, administrators and teachers. In particular, three distinct aspects of school data work are explored: (i) the distinction between official 'mandated' data requirements from external government agencies, and the unofficial efforts to generate and work with 'useful' data; (ii) the highly mediated nature of digital data work within schools; (iii) the ways in which digital data lead to compromised knowledge and 'work arounds'. These findings, it is argued, illustrate the embedding of digital data within secondary schools as a technology of (self)control in ways that tend to reinforce dominant cultures of school administration and management. As such, the paper considers how the restrictive forms of data governance currently at large within school systems might be problematized and acted against. © 2015 British Educational Research Association.},

abstract={Hypertension is a significant risk factor for heart disease and stroke worldwide. Effective treatment regimens exist; however, treatment adherence rates are poor (30%-50%). Improving self-management may be a way to increase adherence to treatment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the phases in the development and preliminary evaluation of an interactive mobile phone-based system aimed at supporting patients in self-managing their hypertension. A person-centered and participatory framework emphasizing patient involvement was used. An interdisciplinary group of researchers, patients with hypertension, and health care professionals who were specialized in hypertension care designed and developed a set of questions and motivational messages for use in an interactive mobile phone-based system. Guided by the US Food and Drug Administration framework for the development of patient-reported outcome measures, the development and evaluation process comprised three major development phases (1, defining; 2, adjusting; 3, confirming the conceptual framework and delivery system) and two evaluation and refinement phases (4, collecting, analyzing, interpreting data; 5, evaluating the self-management system in clinical practice). Evaluation of new mobile health systems in a structured manner is important to understand how various factors affect the development process from both a technical and human perspective. Forthcoming analyses will evaluate the effectiveness and utility of the mobile phone-based system in supporting the self-management of hypertension. © 2014 Hallberg et al.},

abstract={Covering a decade during which the "digital divide" came to popular and political attention, and written at a time when the Internet continues to be championed as a means of widening access to educational opportunities, this paper presents an analysis of the social, economic and educational characteristics associated with using the Internet for educational purposes. The research was conducted using nationally-representative, individual-level, repeated cross-sectional data (n = 47,001) collected in annual surveys of adults in the UK between 2002 and 2010. The results of multivariate analyses show that although there was a substantial increase in both Internet access and non-educational use of the Internet during this period, there was comparatively little growth in "educational" Internet use. As with participation in adult learning more generally, educational Internet use was structured by age, occupational class and educational engagement. The growth in the availability of Internet access and the development of new technologies appears to have neither increased nor widened participation in adult learning. This growth does not appear to have impacted on the social characteristics of those who use the Internet for educational purposes, nor led to any substantial uptake in Internet-based learning among already educationally-active groups. © 2012 Copyright Educational Review.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to investigate how young people are using school-based sources of sex and relationships education (SRE) to obtain information and advice. Design/methodology/approach - The paper shows how anonymous self-completion questionnaires were administered to young people aged between 12 and 19 years in three secondary school and six out-of-school youth settings (n=401). Follow-up focus group interviews were conducted with 12 groups of young people from the school and out-of-school settings (n=57). Findings - The paper finds that school lessons were the most frequent source of sex and relationships information for many young people. Lessons were reported to be most useful for students who were male, younger and more educationally engaged. School lessons were widely criticised by young people as predominantly focusing on biological aspects of sex and relationships and lacking a discursive or participatory element. Young people perceived a diminishing commitment to SRE by teachers as they progressed into later years. Research limitations/implications - The paper examines a predominantly working-class sample of young people from one urban area of South Wales. Practical implications/implications - On the basis of the data analysis in this paper a number of suggestions are made regarding the nature of future school provision of SRE. Originality/value - This paper raises awareness and highlights issues surrounding the role of schools, teachers and school nurses in sex and relationships education. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article takes as its background the shift over time in Britain towards models of target setting in education which are based almost entirely on measurable outputs. The original 'headline' targets proposed by the National Council for Educational Technology were of a very different nature, as are those of many other developed nations. The article outlines some alternative models involving targets for both inputs and processes, and the use of targets which are exhortative rather than directly measurable. It is suggested that the main reason these more 'qualitative' targets have disappeared from British policy-making is that they are not considered to be directly measurable. This is contrasted, at least in some accounts, with the more visible output indicators. However, the substantive purpose of this article is show how weak the claim is that we can ever adequately measure even these privileged targets. The article therefore argues that if a policy of target setting is to be pursued, and given other findings from the authors' study in Wales this is far from clear, then more sophisticated models than those in current vogue may be required. The expense involved in setting up such an extension to our already heavily audited society may be unjustified-for it is surely better to spend money on improving lifelong learning even if we cannot measure that improvement definitively, than to have an accurate metric revealing a picture of stagnation or worse.},

abstract={'Realising the potential of new technology' was one of the central educational themes of New Labour's 1997 election manifesto, with 'information and communications technology' (ICT) established subsequently as a prominent feature of the Blair administration policy portfolio. As such New Labour can claim rightly to have made an unprecedented and sustained political commitment to technology in education, directing over £5 billion of funding towards educational ICT during the 1997 to 2007 period. Yet the fact remains that the New Labour ICT agenda has failed to achieve the much promised technological 'transformation' of the UK education system. With this in mind the present paper develops the argument that New Labour's concern with educational ICT was driven primarily by concerns over enhancing competitiveness in a globalising economy, creating a lifelong learning system fit for a successful knowledge economy and modernising the formal education sector. Thus whilst New Labour's ICT agenda may well have had the short term impact of increasing the physical presence of ICT resources in all education institutions, its longer-term educational legacy was compromised by the wider macro-level issues it purported to address. As such the legacy of this high-profile segment of policy-making should be seen primarily in terms of establishing ICT as an ideological presence in the UK education system.},

abstract={The £1 billion government drive to integrate information and communications technology (ICT) into UK schools and colleges has been firmly focused on the technological transformation of the teaching profession. In particular, the establishment of a National Grid for Learning (NGfL) remains dependent on the successful 'selling' of ICT to teachers; many of whom have previously proved unwilling to use computers. In practice much of this task has been left to IT firms, eager to promote their products to a potentially lucrative educational marketplace. From this basis the present paper takes a detailed examination of educational computing advertising material currently being produced by IT firms in the UK. In particular it concentrates on how advertisements construct both the process of education and the teacher as a potential user of ICT. Four dominant themes emerge from this analysis: ICT as problematic for teachers; ICT as a problem solver for teachers; ICT as a futuristic form of education; and ICT as a traditional form of education. Despite the conflicting, and often contra-factual, nature of these four discourses the paper argues that educational computing advertising is consistent in its disempowering portrayal of the teacher at the expense of both the computer and IT firm. This 'demotion' of the teacher is likely to have negative effects on the way that teachers approach ICT as part of their professional routine, running contrary to the underlying aims of the National Grid for Learning initiative. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Involving around £1 billion of expenditure over a five-year period, the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) initiative embodies the fast growing influence of both market and technological forces in UK education. The formation of the initiative can, therefore, be seen as a pivotal signpost for the direction of New Labour education policy-making, particularly with regard to the increased roles of the private sector and quasi-governmental actors in the development and eventual implementation of educational policy. Based on data gathered from a series of in-depth interviews with ‘key actors’ in the formation and initial implementation of the NGfL, this paper details the formation of the initiative and explores the mechanisms and structures of power and decision-making employed during its formation. Adopting the analytical frameworks of ‘policy community’ and ‘policy network’, the emergence and ‘roll-out’ of the National Grid for Learning is discussed in three distinct phases: the origins of the initiative; its initial policy formation; and, finally, its ongoing implementation and first stages of becoming a policy-in-practice. The paper concludes by discussing the NGfL as an example of current UK education policy-making and examines the national and global precedents underlying the nature of its formation. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The National Grid for Learning (NGfL) not only represents the most ambitious educational computing initiative to date but also heralds one of the largest public/private education policy partnerships the UK has even seen. In reflecting the growing influence of market and technological forces the NGfL should, therefore, be treated as a significant education signpost for the new century. Before the initiative reaches full operation a major step in the 'construction' of the Learning Grid has been its formation within government and official discourse. This discursive construction is important inasmuch as it makes an 'ethereal' initiative a tangible concern, shaping expectations among both the education and business communities and consequently influencing the future effectiveness of the NGfL. From this basis, the present article examines how the National Grid for Learning is being discursively constructed by government and official actors at a macro level through policy and advisory documents, official statements and other rhetoric. In doing so the article highlights how the NGfL is being shaped within a restrictive technocratic and determinist discourse, thus conforming to traditional narratives of society and technology. The paper then aims to show how such construction negates crucial social and economic elements of the initiative and threatens, ultimately, to restrict the eventual educational effectiveness of the Grid.},

In this paper we report on the extent to which schools are already buying into information and communications technology (ICT) and in particular the Internet, effectively examining the foundations upon which the Learning Grid is being constructed. Via an empirical study of 150 current school websites we will argue that schools adopt a variety of approaches to the Internet and Worldwide Web depending upon the technological and institutional capital of the school, and that far from being utilised solely for educational purposes, the Internet provides an additional tool through which schools seek to reaffirm or reconstruct their existing institutional identities with varying levels of success. The paper concludes by adopting a semiotic framework for analysing the differential use of the Internet by educational institutions.},

In particular four popular assumptions of the social web are challenged, namely: (i) expectations of enhanced participatory learning; (ii) expectations of enhanced equality of opportunity; (iii) expectations of learner affinity and interest; and (iv) expectations of freedom from proprietary constraints. The paper contends that many of these expectations stem from a tendency for education technology researchers and writers to over-value seemingly 'new' informal uses of the social web, whilst downplaying unequal power relations between individual learners and formal processes of education. The paper concludes that educationalists and technologists alike should strive to look beyond the rhetoric of the social web, and develop realistic and critical understandings of the 'messy' realities of social web technologies and education. © 2015 Author(s).},

abstract={Whilst many authors are now confident to dismiss the notion of the digital divide, this paper argues that inequalities in ICT use in contemporary higher education are of growing rather than diminishing importance. In particular, it argues that there is an urgent need for the higher education community to develop more sophisticated understandings of the nature of the digital divisions that exist within current cohorts of university students - not least inequalities of 'effective' use of ICT to access information and knowledge. With these thoughts in mind, the paper presents a review of recent research and theoretical work in the area of digital exclusion and the digital divide, and considers a number of reasons why digital exclusion remains a complex and entrenched social problem within populations of higher education students.},

abstract={The relatively restricted nature of children's use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) inside the school setting has long been noted by researchers. With this in mind, this article offers a grounded analysis of drawings collected from 355 primary pupils (years three to six) from five English primary schools depicting desired future forms of school ICT provision. The article contends that the nature and content of these future orientated pictures reflect many of the tensions underlying children's current engagements with ICTs in school. Specifically the article discusses how the drawings offer valuable insights into the issues underlying pupils' understandings of ICT and schools, not least: the restrictions of the school as organisation; the oppositional relationship between the 'work' of learning in school and the 'play' of using digital media at home; the unequal power relations that exist between pupils, schools and teachers. The article concludes that rather than accede to demands for free and unfettered use of game consoles and portable devices in the classroom, schools should instead concentrate on fostering informed dialogues with young people about the potential educational benefits of school ICT use. © 2009 British Educational Research Association.},

abstract={The assessment of students' ability to use computers should be a central tenet of educational computing research, but until now most studies have relied on vague and imprecise definitions of what actually constitutes being able to use a computer. More often than not researchers are content to accept a self-evaluation from the student, often in the form of a response to a single question, and even the more elaborate attempts to measure ability have proved too narrow or ill-focused to be of lasting value. This paper argues that before attempting to assess computer ability the overall nature of the concept should first be considered. From this, a theoretical framework of ability can then be constructed on which to base subsequent practical assessment. The paper also raises methodological issues to be considered by future research into students' use of computers.},

abstract={This chapter discusses how digital exclusion continues to present a serious and significant threat to the successful establishment of developed and developing countries as 'information societies.' Based on a review of recent research and theoretical work, the chapter considers a number of different reasons why digital exclusion remains a complex and entrenched social problem, highlighting the need to recognise the mediating role of economic, cultural, and social forms of capital in shaping individuals' engagements with ICT. From this basis, the chapter proposes a hierarchical framework of digital exclusion based around conceptual 'stages' of ICT use. Using this framework, the argument is made that policymakers, technologists, and other information society stakeholders face a considerable challenge to match the social affordances of ICTs with the everyday needs, interests, and desires of individuals. In this sense, digital exclusion continues to demand a complex set of policy responses which go far beyond simply increasing levels of hardware provision and support, and then assuming any 'gaps' to have been 'bridged.' The chapter concludes by highlighting a number of possible directions for future action. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={The concept of 'flexibility' lies at the heart of contemporary post-compulsory education. Educational institutions are now expected to take a flexible approach to their provision of courses, as well as staffing, curriculum and assessment arrangements. Similarly, individual learners are expected to take an increasingly pragmatic, adaptable and reflexive approach to their studies. While a number of academic critiques have focused on the implications of these shifts from the point of view of educational institutions and those who work within them, less attention has been paid to how individual learners encounter and act upon the presumed flexibilities of their educational engagement. This paper examines how notions of flexibility were present within the individual 'learner experience' of a varied sample of distance learners (n=60) from around the world, all taking UK-provided degree courses. Drawing on in-depth interview data, the paper highlights a set of recurring tensions between individual agency and social structure that appear to underpin the distance learner experience. In particular, the paper discusses how most learners managed to sustain only a limited 'strategic flexibility' towards their learning- especially in terms of negotiating issues of time, space, place and existing familial and employment roles. Moreover, the extent to which individuals were able to 'conduct' the nature of their studies appears to be influenced significantly by gender, lifestage and employment/occupational status. The paper therefore concludes by discussing the need to adjust academic and policy assumptions of the 'freedoms' of globalised distance education. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

In this sense, traditional concerns over supporting the development of ‘digital literacy’ are now being usurped by concerns over citizens’ ‘data literacies’. In contrast to recent data safety and data science approaches, this article argues for a more critical form of ‘personal data literacies’ where digital data are understood as socially situated and context dependent. Drawing on the critical literacies tradition, the article outlines a range of salient socio-technical understandings of personal data generation and processing. Specifically, the article proposes a framework of ‘Personal Data Literacies’ that distinguishes five significant domains: (1) Data Identification, (2) Data Understandings, (3) Data Reflexivity, (4) Data Uses, and (5) Data Tactics. The article concludes by outlining the implications of this framework for future education and research around the area of individuals’ understandings of personal data. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={The past decade has seen the expansion of personal digital technologies into schools. With many students and teachers now possessing smartphones, tablets, and laptops, schools are initiating one-to-one and ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD) policies aiming to make use of these ‘personal devices’ in classrooms. While often discussed in terms of possible educational benefits and/or organisational risks, the actual presence of personal devices in schools tends to be more mundane in nature and effect. Drawing upon ethnographic studies of three Australian high schools, this paper details ways in which the proliferation of digital devices has come to bear upon everyday experiences of school. In particular, the paper highlights the ways in which staff and students negotiate (in)appropriate technology engagement; the ordinary (rather than extraordinary) ways that students make use of their devices in classrooms; and the device-related tensions now beginning to arise in schools. Rather than constituting a radically ‘transformational’ form of schooling, the paper considers how the heightened presence of personal technologies is becoming subsumed into existing micro-politics of school organisation and control. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This paper investigates students’ experiences of school as a context for digital technology use. Drawing upon survey data from three Australian secondary schools (n = 1174), this paper considers the various ways in which students use digital devices and applications “in school” and “for school”. After highlighting trends and differences across a range of digital devices and practices, the paper explores the ways in which students perceive school as a limiting and/or enabling setting for technology use. The findings point to a number of ways that schools act to extend as well as curtail student engagement with technology.

abstract={This article draws from ethnographic data produced inside mathematics teacher education in Sweden. It explores and makes visible the ongoing process of education during workshops in information and communication technology (ICT) laboratory contexts in which student teachers were working with spreadsheet applications on the computer. The main finding is that, contrary to the intentions to renew and revitalise education, ICT in use seemed to operate as a relay in the reproduction of traditional ways of teaching and learning. However, the investigation is not one of the failures of education to make use of ICT but one that tries to distance itself from the traditional enthusiastic rhetoric, with the ambition to contribute to a more realistic discussion. Bernstein's concept of pedagogical discourse has been used. One education setting has been studied in detail. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={New representational technologies, such as virtual microscopy, create new affordances for medical education. In the article, a study on the following two issues is reported: (a) How does collaborative use of virtual microscopy shape students' engagement with and learning from virtual slides of tissue specimen? (b) How do visual and conceptual cues scaffold students' reasoning? Fifteen pairs of medical students participated in two sessions in which the students used a virtual microscope as a diagnostic tool in the context of learning pathology. The slides provided the students with varying levels of visual and conceptual cueing. The sessions were videotaped, and the students' reasoning while using the microscope was analysed. The students' written answers were analysed in terms of the findings they made and the diagnoses suggested. At a general level, the results show that students engage actively in this kind of virtually-mediated environment. The visual and/or conceptual cues improve students' performance, and guide the students' perception and reasoning in a manner that is productive from the point of view of learning to make clinically relevant observations. Scaffolding students' reasoning process through cues furthermore assists the students in avoiding the most obvious pitfalls such as overlooking critical areas of a specimen. Overall, visual and conceptual cues improve students' reasoning in perceptual and cognitive terms, while still allowing space for the making of "relevant mistakes" that may further the students' diagnostic skills. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Based on data drawn from a large-scale study of adults in the West of England and South Wales, the paper addresses three areas of inquiry: (i) how computers and the Internet are used in adults' engagement with self-education; (ii) why adults engage (or do not engage) in IT-based self-education; and (iii) the social stratification of adults' engagement in IT-based self-education. The paper concludes that although computers and the Internet are, indeed, being used by some adults for self-education (often in extensive and elaborate ways), they appear to be reinforcing rather than activating processes of self-education, allowing people to continue with pre-existing and pre-set patterns of informal learning which generally replicate and reinforce patterns of ‘offline’ self- education. © 2006, © 2006 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

There is growing interest, therefore, in how networks of corporate and state policy actors implicit in the formation of (inter)national education technology agendas intersect with local school systems and teachers. In particular, this paper explores the significant policy work that takes place outside schools and classrooms through education trade shows. Based on an in-depth ‘event ethnography’ of one large Scandinavian educational technology show, the paper details how these events function as sites of policy interpretation–‘sharing’ (or more accurately ‘selling’) global ideas and imperatives to local schools and teachers. These findings highlight the role of trade shows in consolidating policy networks, subsuming public education interests into corporate concerns, and differentiating teacher subjectivities and encouraging teacher entrepreneurship. The paper problematizes the ways in which teacher agency is shaped and controlled by the discursive, material and affective dimensions of such events. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Social media are now an important aspect of the professional lives of school teachers. This paper explores the growing use of mass ‘teacher groups’ and ‘teacher communities’ on social media platforms such as Facebook. While these online communities are often welcomed as a means of professional learning and support, the paper considers the extent to which Facebook groups also expose teachers to some of the less beneficial aspects of social media, such as various forms of ‘digital labour’, commercialisation of exchanges and predominance of individualised reputation-driven behaviours. Drawing on a detailed examination of a Swedish teacher Facebook group of over 13,000 members, the paper first addresses aspects of the online community that could be seen as professionally beneficial and/or valuable—particularly in terms of information exchange and social support. Yet while perceived by participants as a relatively beneficial and uncontroversial aspect of their working lives, the research also points to characteristics of the Facebook group that constituted disadvantaging, exploitative and/or disempowering forms of technological engagement. In these terms, the paper highlights tensions between what appears to ‘work’ for individual teachers in the short term and likely longer-term implications that these practices might have for diminished professionalism and expertise of teachers. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Digital competence and digital literacy are concepts that are increasingly used in public discourse. However, how the concepts are used and how they are defined remains unclear. This paper presents a systematic review of research where these concepts are used in higher education research. The aim is to establish an understanding of referencing strategy to digital literacy and digital competence over time, disciplines, countries, methods and level of analysis. Three databases were used in the systematic literature review: Web of Science, Scopus and Education Resources Information Centre. We delimited the search to title, abstract and keywords in the databases. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed publications written in English. Initially 107 publications between 1997 and 2017 were found, with 28 addressing digital competence and 79 digital literacy. Our review demonstrates that there is a range of definitions used in higher education research. They vary depending on if the concepts are defined by policy, research or both and whether they focus on technical skills or social practices. This review indicates directions for further research in higher education i) do more research based on critical perspectives to avoid commonsensical use of the concepts, ii) take the development of definitions of these concepts seriously iii) avoid cross-referencing incompatibilities and finally iv) engage in critical investigations regarding the legitimacy of policy over research in the domain of higher education research. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The article draws upon data gathered from a survey of 253 masters and postgraduate diploma/certificate students across two universities in Australia. Analysis of these data contrasts the varied use(fulness) of ‘official’ university technologies such as learning management systems and library resources against ‘unofficial’ technologies such as Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook and free/open education resources. In particular, the data highlight notable differences between students by subject area, domicile, mode of study and academic performance. The data also highlight the perceived benefits of this technology use – with students primarily finding digital technology useful in terms of supporting the logistics of university study rather than matters of learning per se. The article concludes by considering what is missing from these current forms of technological engagement, particularly in comparison with wider discourses about the educational potential of recent digital technologies. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={According to governments around the world, developing and sustaining technological skills and competencies are seen to be a key part of a student's ability to engage with twenty-first century schooling. Yet to what extent do students believe in the association between technological competence and their success at school? This short research paper presents an initial analysis of data from a large-scale survey of secondary-school students in England (n=1303). Analysis of these data suggests that official expectations about the close linkages between scholastic success and information and communication technology (ICT) use are not necessarily shared by students themselves. For example, students' belief in the educational value of ICT competence was low in comparison to their beliefs about technology use in other areas of their lives. Belief in the educational value of ICT competence was also found to be at its highest with students in their initial year of secondary schooling, and at diminished levels with students studying in all other year groups. Moreover, belief in the educational value of ICT competence was highest for those students who had less opportunity to access computers or the Internet. It is suggested that these data could reflect a trend of older and more experienced students coming to realise that technological competence is of limited scholastic value - in contrast to official portrayals of the educational benefits of technology use. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Although there is a growing interest in the victimisation of university students, the issue of student offending has been largely overlooked in the criminology and education literatures. Based on a self-report study of 1215 undergraduate students at UK higher education institutions, this article explores the level and nature of student perpetration of criminal acts whilst at university, as well as students' understandings and rationalisations of their criminal behaviours. Whilst the data show the majority of students to be involved in what can be classed as minor, and often anti-social, offending rather than more serious crime, there was also a sense from respondents that such offences were often an accepted and sometimes expected part of the everyday 'student experience'. The article, therefore, goes on to discuss the extent to which student offending is part of a distinct 'undergraduate habitus', rather than being merely symptomatic of general societal trends of young people and crime. The article concludes by considering what implications this analysis may have for future attempts to address student offending by universities and crime enforcement authorities.},

abstract={Giving students opportunities to work collaboratively with complex online information is important for the development of democratic citizenship, but providing and structuring these opportunities poses pedagogical challenges. In this study, we investigate how digital mapping tools developed within Science and Technology Studies (STS) are used by upper secondary science students for the collaborative exploration and ordering of controversial socio-scientific issues (SSIs) found online. Our sociocultural approach to detailed analysis of video data reveals how students synchronously construct shared interactive visualizations and respond collaboratively to mediating features of the network visualization tool for handling multiple perspectives and information encountered online. The analysis shows how the tool-mediated activity provided means for students to work out what is relevant and useful in a corpus of online data. We unpack the details of the complex dynamics of this process of evaluating and categorizing websites, uncovering ways that interaction with emerging knowledge artefacts is co-constitutive of participation in the local setting. In particular, this analysis reveals how the tool-mediating activity slows down the process of judging and categorizing online material in terms of criteria such as institutional status, trustworthiness, and position of a controversy. Furthermore, it reveals that alignments and misalignments between the digital tool used and students’ own logics prompted students to engage in productive collaborative negotiation of how to make sense of a controversy. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Large amounts of personal data are generated through young people’s engagements with mobile media, with these data increasingly (re)used by advertisers, content developers and other third parties to profile, predict and position individuals. This has prompted growing concerns over the ability of mobile media users to develop informed stances towards how and why their data is being used, i.e. to build ‘conscious’ and/or ‘resistant’ forms of ‘data agency’. This paper explores ways of developing the critical consciousness and resistant practices of young mobile media users towards personal data. Drawing on research with 27 young people (aged 13–17 years), the paper describes efforts to make representations of third party use of personal data openly available as a basis from which to develop data-savvy tactics and strategies. The results of these interventions – while only partially successful – offer valuable insights into the technical, social and cultural issues that shape young people’s engagement with personal data. The paper concludes by considering how concerns over data agency might be better aligned with the realities of young people’s mobile media use. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Within the hyperbole surrounding information and communications technologies (ICTs) and lifelong learning, our understanding of what learning activities ICTs are actually being used for throughout the adult population remains under-developed. Based on a household survey of 1001 adults in the west of England and South Wales, this article considers who amongst the adult population is using ICTs and what they are using them for. Moreover, the article also takes time to consider who is not using ICTs for learning given the widespread claims made about ICTs' potential for social inclusion. The survey data show that within adults' use of computers and the Internet, education and learning are minority activities, most commonly taking the form of informal learning at home. Moreover, any educative use of ICTs appears to be patterned by a number of social factors. In particular, logistic regression analysis shows that whether or not an individual uses ICTs for educative purposes can be predicted (with 82% accuracy) by the five variables of age, gender, educational background, occupational class and area of residence. The article concludes by discussing these findings in relation to the United Kingdom Government's present lifelong learning agenda. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Beneath the renewed political emphasis on computer use in primary (K-6) schools the place for the pupil has been somewhat taken-for-granted. Indeed, the current U.K. National Grid for Learning initiative is founded on the underlying assumption that children will quickly and effortlessly adapt to using new technologies. This article, therefore, explores the perceptions and views of primary school children in explaining, discussing, and rationalizing their use (or otherwise) of computers in the primary classroom. Based on focus group interview data with 267 pupils from five schools in South and Mid-Wales, the article presents four recurring themes which children used to understand and describe their engagement with computers in school. These are broadly grouped into: (1) the speed and ease of work-processes when using computers; (2) the extending or curtailing of learners' abilities when using computers; (3) freedoms and restrictions of the finished product when using computers and, finally, (4) concerns over originality and authenticity when using computers. From this basis the article goes onto discuss possible ways of more effectively presenting computers to pupils in classroom settings through both policy and practice.},

abstract={This article summarizes some emerging concerns as learning analytics become implemented throughout education. The article takes a sociotechnical perspective — positioning learning analytics as shaped by a range of social, cultural, political, and economic factors. In this manner, various concerns are outlined regarding the propensity of learning analytics to entrench and deepen the status quo, disempower and disenfranchise vulnerable groups, and further subjugate public education to the profit-led machinations of the burgeoning “data economy.” In light of these charges, the article briefly considers some possible areas of change. These include the design of analytics applications that are more open and accessible, that offer genuine control and oversight to users, and that better reflect students’ lived reality. The article also considers ways of rethinking the political economy of the learning analytics industry. Above all, learning analytics researchers need to begin talking more openly about the values and politics of data-driven analytics technologies as they are implemented along mass lines throughout school and university contexts. © 2019, UTS ePRESS.

abstract={Maritime traffic, like most traffic, is rule-governed. In situations in which multiple vessels traffic the same waters, anti-collision regulations enable bridge teams to coordinate their actions with those of other vessels. In maritime education, simulators provide a safe environment for students to begin practicing the application of anti-collision regulations to different traffic situations. This study explores how aspects of rule appliance, analytically understood as professional vision and professional intersubjectivity, are trained in a simulator environment by analyses of a video-recorded episode from a navigation course. The results show how instructions during the scenario are continuous achievements that build on an instructor's ability to recognize the fit between learning objectives and on-going activities in the simulator as they unfold. These embedded assessments and their subsequent demonstrations draw on several social and material resources in the simulator environment. In the simulator, the instructor demonstrates the rule system as a dialogical practice where one interprets each other in line with the rules in negotiations between vessels. This interpretation requires a level of professional intersubjectivity that goes beyond merely following rules, towards seeing oneself through the eyes of others with regard to the intentions projected in one's manoeuvring actions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Over the years, the role and extent of the basic sciences in medical curricula have been challenged by research on clinical expertise, clinical teachers, and medical students, as well as by the development and diversification of the medical curricula themselves. The aim of this study was to examine how prior knowledge of basic histology and histopathology among students predicts early learning of diagnostic pathology. Participants (N=118, representing 91% of the full student cohort) were medical students at the University of Turku, Finland. Data were collected during two preclinical courses that students attended in their first and second years of medical school. The measurements included tests on biomedical and clinical knowledge and a performance test in diagnostic pathology. Second-year performance on the diagnostic pathology examinations was predicted by the students' prior knowledge of histology, but not by the students' prior knowledge of histopathology. Although earlier research has demonstrated similar results in studies with shorter longitudinal designs, the present study demonstrates that the effect remains even if there is a considerably long time delay (a year) between the measurements, thus confirming the long-term value of basic science studies in the preclinical phase. © 2013 American Association of Anatomists.},

abstract={While it is generally acknowledged that being 'historically informed' lies at the heart of critical accounts of education policy-making, the use of historically focused retrospective research methods within the field is rare. This paper makes the case for retrospective research at a time when some of the most significant episodes of post-war educational policy-making are fast passing into the realms of not-so-recent history. In particular, it is argued that current policy scholars now have an opportunity to revisit the issues and concerns regarding the formation of the 'New Right' education policy reforms 30 years ago. Drawing on the experiences of a recently completed study of educational policy-making during the 1979-1983 Thatcher administration, it is argued that retrospective methods offer a surprisingly rich opportunity to collect primary data from the policy elites of the 1980s. It is concluded that the time is right for the production of a useful addendum to the founding studies of educational policy sociology that were conducted at the time. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The growing importance of medical imaging in everyday diagnostic practices poses challenges for medical education. While the emergence of novel imaging technologies offers new opportunities, many pedagogical questions remain. In the present study, we explore the use of a new tool, a virtual microscope, for the instruction and the collaborative learning of pathology. Fifteen pairs of medical students were asked to solve diagnostic tasks in a virtual microscopy learning environment. The students' collaborative efforts were analysed on the basis of approximately 20 hours of video recordings. Our analyses show how students use the technology as a mediating tool to organize, manipulate and construct a shared visual field, and later, shared understanding of the problem and solutions. Organization of the visual field is done through multimodal referential practices: gestures, three dimensional manipulation of the image and paced inspection of the specimen. Furthermore, we analyse and describe how the aforementioned practices coincide with students' medical reasoning in this particular learning context. The analysis of medical students' diagnostic work illustrates the collaborative potential of the virtual microscopy environment and how such interactive tools render the traditional distinction between collaborating around or through computers irrelevant, as even face to face collaboration becomes enacted through technology. Finally, we argue that as technologies develop, understanding the technical side of image production, or any representation, becomes an integral part of the interpretative process. How this knowledge is communicated to the students may play a substantive role in how students learn to interpret medical images. © 2012 International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.; Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Schools' use of digital technology has so far proved to be a peripheral feature of the Conservative-Liberal education agenda. Through a series of reductions to previously extensive bureaucratic and funding structures, the Coalition administration has presided over a swift but sustained withdrawal of state support for digital technology use in schools. Many commentators have been quick to decry these actions as signalling an ill-informed "absence of ambition" for what could be seen as an integral area of twenty-first century educational provision. However, this paper contends that the Coalition's apparent technological indifference instead marks a deliberate "ambition of absence". Thus as well as contributing to immediate reductions in central government spending, the apparent shunning of educational technology policy-making has been driven by the Coalition's long-term ambitions for localised and largely privatised forms of public sector governance. With this in mind, the paper considers the intended influence of the Coalition's policy reversals on the future use of digital technology in UK schools. It is suggested that rather than constituting an irreversible crisis, the current withdrawal of state support is perhaps best understood as a continuation of the fluctuating cycle of government (dis)interest in educational technology over the past 30 years. © 2011 Copyright Educational Review.},

abstract={The Internet has recently been heralded by both politicians and educators as a ready means of promoting 'lifelong learning' and widening the numbers of adults participating in education. Yet, despite such enthusiasm, the use of technology to attract adults to lifelong learning is only now beginning to be implemented on a widespread basis. Thus much of the technology-based vision of a 'learning society' remains empirically unproven. This paper, therefore, concentrates on the longer-established efforts being made in Wales to use the Internet as a gateway for learning opportunities for adult learners. Focusing on a Web-based Welsh language programme over a 12 month period the paper empirically examines the role of the Internet in providing effective access procedures to adult learning and, moreover, gains a sense of who such methods are attracting and what learners are beginning to use the Internet for. In particular the paper examines: how the programme was presented on the Internet; when learners were using the Internet-based learning programme and what they were using it for; and, finally, who was accessing the learning programme via the Internet and how usage of the programme reflected the wider goals of extending participation beyond those social groups already engaged in learning.},

Co-production of health services implies fundamental changes in the ways medical care is organized and delivered. Usually, technologies are put forth as potential solutions to problems that might occur when establishing such new relations. Aims: The aim of this study is to scrutinize how different perspectives were brought into the discussions as the concrete design and use of a mobile phone application were introduced, and how participants anticipated and negotiated their own participation in the design project. Methods: This article reports results from an explorative study of a co-design project in hypertension care wherein health professionals and patients were invited to co-design some features of the application they were later to use. Results/Conclusions: The study shows that new practices of self-treatment are not likely to take place without the cooperation of patients, since they are to provide the observational data necessary for the professionals' work. The negotiations are needed to balance patients' concerns of being monitored by technology and their needs of being in control of their everyday lives and activities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

This article draws upon survey data from students (n = 1174) across three Australian secondary schools, examining their experiences and perceptions of school regulation of technology use, as well as the ways in which students accommodate and/or work around such constraints. The data highlight a number of different forms of regulation that students perceive as impeding their in-school engagement with technology – most notably relating to filtering/blocking of content; (dis)possession of personal devices; enforced uses and standardized practices. Conversely, a number of tactics of contestation are also highlighted – including surreptitious uses of digital media; low-level “hacks” and technical reconfigurations; and various other forms of subversion. The article concludes by considering the implications of these findings, and the need for school authorities to work with students to develop negotiated forms of regulation that support expansive and increasingly personalized uses of technology within the school context. © 2015 Educational Review.},

The aim of this pilot study was to examine the visual processes of novice and advanced programmers in authentic tasks. Fifteen novices and eight advanced programmers were given eight short pieces of code. Their task was to either identify an error or give the output of the code. Eye movements and keyboard activity were recorded. On average, the novices spent more time reading the code than composing the response, whereas the more advanced programmers started composing the response sooner and spent more time on it. In general, the advanced programmers had shorter fixations and saccades. The results suggest that the advanced programmers are quicker to grasp the essence of the code and able to see more details in it. The advanced programmers had shorter fixations and saccade lengths during the second phase which might indicate the process of chunking. © 2016 IEEE.},

The data are analysed with a sociocultural perspective on what tools are used, what meanings they mediate and how they are socially constructed. The results show that, while notations were exclusively downloaded from the Internet and almost all students used mobile phones to listen to the songs they performed, other types of IT use were rare. To illustrate more extensive use, one case involving how to play the bridge in a song has been analysed in detail. This speaks to the broader finding of the study that the availability of IT and the potential for seeking information and creating music implies little on its own for how technology is used in music classrooms. Pedagogical implications are discussed in relation to the intersection between formal and informal learning and IT use in music education. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Article.},

It illuminates the reflexive processes of inscription, translation and re-inscription as technologies evolve by examining the development and classroom use of Texas Instruments' TI-Nspire™. To investigate the development and use of TI-Nspire, research from the field of Science and Technology Studies is drawn on that provides insights into the relationship between development, technology, and users while avoiding essentialist positions that obscure either technological or human aspects of the relationship. The findings show that rather than being a linear process where the technology is passed from developer to teacher to student, the development and use of TI-Nspire involves multiple feedback loops with constant reconfiguration. These loops occur at several levels as teachers and students integrate the technology into their mathematical activity and these reconfigurations feed into new versions of the technology. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

abstract={Popular approaches in the learning sciences understand the concept of learning as permanent or semi-permanent changes in how individuals think and act. These changes can be traced very differently, depending on whether the context is stable or dynamic. The purpose of this poster is to introduce a distinction between horizontal and vertical transitions that can be used to describe individual and institutional change in technology-rich environments. We argue that these two types of transitions trace different phenomena: Vertical transitions occur when individuals, technologies, or domains develop in stable and fixed conditions within set boundaries. In contrast, horizontal transitions occur when individuals, technologies, or domains mature in the synergy with other fields. We develop our argument by working through relevant studies in medicine, and close by outlining implications for future research on professional technology enhanced learning. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In the United Kingdom, since 1997, the New Labour gvernment, along with other public and private actors with vested interests, has been responsible for a steady but subtle (re)construction and (re)positioning of ‘lifelong learning’ – ostensibly moving away from a notion based upon an economic compulsion for individuals to participate in credentialised vocational education and training. A significant element of this shift has been the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) in a rebranding of lifelong learning from an avowedly economic concern to a societal and even moral pursuit for the ‘information age’. This article considers how this ‘technofication’ of lifelong learning has been engineered to appear as constituting a ‘remoralisation’ of education and training; i.e. a reconstruction of lifelong learning as more than just an economic duty, but also as a civic and societal duty for the information age as well as being a ‘good’ and intrinsically nourishing activity for individuals to pursue. Having mapped out the nature of these ‘new’ imperatives and the discourses surrounding them, the article then goes onto assess the likelihood of these technology-based forms of learning achieving the goal of stimulating sustained lifelong learning for all individuals in society where previous policymaking has failed. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In this article, we argue that students’ unfolding discourse on socio-scientific issues (SSI) can be fruitfully analyzed by using dialogical theories of language and communication (Bakhtin 1986; Linell 2009). While research in science education often reports on how individual reasoning changes when bringing SSI into the classroom, we argue for the relevance of analyzing how the individual is “in dialogue” with present as well as remote interlocutors and contexts on the internet. We suggest that the analytical approach is particularly sensitized to illuminate how students’ handle multiple perspectives. A dialogical perspective takes as its premise that SSI are part of society, where politicians, interest groups, and scientists engage in debates and offer perspectives that are often in conflict. Rather than assuming that the individual student is the primary unit for analysis, a dialogical approach is premised on an analysis that incorporates several perspectives and voices—a multivocality that also resides with the individual. Arguing for the relevance of this analytical approach to studies of SSI in the classroom, we analyze a group of students in upper secondary school as they discuss hydraulic fracturing after having worked with online data. The results illuminate how students discursively manage multivocality and multimodality inherent in the following SSI online. We describe a set of discursive means that the students use to handle the many perspectives involved when communicating about the issue. In addition, we describe and articulate what kind of communicative competences that are involved and, hence, could be cultivated through education, when engaging in public debates. © 2017, The Author(s).},

This comparative policy paper traces the ‘policy mobilities,’ ‘fast policy’ processes and distributed ‘policy assemblages’ that have led to the introduction of new computer programming practices into schools and curricula in England, Sweden and Australia. Across the three contexts, government advisors and ministers, venture capital firms, think tanks and philanthropic foundations, non-profit organizations and commercial companies alike have promoted computer programming in schools according to a variety of purposes, aspirations, and commitments. This paper maps and traces the evolution of the organizational networks in each country in order to provide a comparative analysis of computing in schools as an exemplar of accelerated, transnationalizing policy mobility. The analysis demonstrates how computing in schools policy has been assembled through considerable effort to create alignments between diverse actors, the production and circulation of material objects, significant cross-border movement of ideas, people and devices, and the creation of strategic partnerships between government centres and commercial vendors. Computing in schools exemplifies how modern education policy and governance is accomplished through sprawling assemblages of actors, events, materials, money and technologies that move across social, governmental and geographical boundaries. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Digital fabrication and ‘3D Making’ are prominent recent additions to school curricula, hastened by the increased affordability of Computer Assisted Design software and devices such as 3D printers. It is increasingly argued that classroom use of these technologies can re-orientate schools towards forms of skills and knowledge appropriate for contemporary industry, STEM education and ‘Maker culture’. Amidst such rhetoric, questions are raised about how these technologies are being used in schools, and the extent to which this represents ‘new’ and/or ‘innovative’ forms of education. This paper presents an ethnographic investigation of a 3D printing course enacted in an Australian high school. These curricular activities are considered from three different perspectives: (i) the artefacts and devices involved in the project; (ii) the surrounding social and educational contexts; and (iii) the activities and practices implicit in the implementation of the project. These different levels of analysis highlight the complexities of technology-based schooling–not least the ways in which possible technical and/or pedagogical ‘innovations’ associated with 3D printing are shaped by the situational constraints of school contexts. The paper concludes by considering the likely future(s) of 3D printing and other forms of digital fabrication within the institutional confines of school. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This article draws from data produced during subject theory lectures and in conversional interviews with students from an ongoing ethnographic study of mathematics teacher education at a Swedish University. Using Bernsteins' language of description of the pedagogic device the article describes how the aims of teacher education to re-contextualise mathematical education towards greater student subject knowledge is thwarted by a strongly classified and framed practice that obstructs student teachers from developing a vertical knowledge structure in mathematics due to performative priorities. The mathematical knowledge to which students are subjected takes more the form of a horizontal discourse and this is problematic for their knowledge development. A horizontal discourse reduces student access to important forms of knowledge by which they can challenge tradition and consciously change their practice. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The recent proposals to include information technology (IT) as a compulsory ‘key skill’ element throughout all areas of the 16-19 curriculum would seem to herald the end ofthe largely ‘computer-free’ A-level curriculum. Yet, the appropriateness of this impositionhas largely been taken for granted by policy-makers and educationalists alike. In an attemptto pre-empt the imposition of compulsory IT use at A level, this paper uses qualitativedata from 96 students and 29 teaching staff, in both school-based sixth forms and furthereducation colleges, to explore the current role of IT in the A-level curriculum. From thisbasis, current attempts at an institutional level to provide an IT element for all A-levelstudents are also examined. As the interview data reveal, many teachers and students seeIT as a superfluous to the ‘real’ objectives of taking A levels and are largely hostile or, atbest, indifferent to using IT. In the light of these findings, the place of IT as a core skill inthe A-level curriculum is reassessed. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={One of the immediate effects of the United Kingdom National Grid for Learning initiative has been the rapidly increasing commercial interest in the educational use of information and communications technology (ICT) and the growth of associated advertising aimed towards a teacher audience. However, an unfamiliarity with educational ICT means that many companies are ‘selling’ their products to teachers for the first time. Acknowledging the importance of this commercial ‘construction’ of the relationship between teachers and computers, this article examines a selection of recent educational ICT advertisements in terms of the depiction and positioning of teachers, technology, students and information technology (IT) firms. After highlighting the relative lack of teacher representation within the advertisements, the article focuses on the recurring representation of teachers and technology on a ‘dream’/’nightmare’ basis; where technology and IT firms are presented as enabling the ‘dream’ of individualised learning free from the ‘nightmare’ of the teacher’s involvement. Having traced the roots of this discourse within wider educational thinking, we consider how ICT could be presented to teachers in a more positive and realistic manner. © 1996 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Young people’s engagements with social media now generate large quantities of personal data, with “big social data” becoming an increasingly important “currency” in the digital economy. While using social media platforms is ostensibly “free,” users nevertheless “pay” for these services through their personal data—enabling advertisers, content developers, and other third parties to profile, predict, and position individuals. Such developments have prompted calls for social media users to adopt more informed and critical stances toward how and why their data are being used—that is, to build “critical data literacies.” This article reports on research that explores young social media users’ understandings of their personal data and its attendant issues. Drawing on research with groups of young people (aged 13–17 years), the article investigates the consequences of making third party (re)uses of personal data openly available for social media users to interpret and make critical sense of. The findings provide valuable insights into young people’s understandings of the technical, social, and cultural issues that underpin their ability to engage with, and make sense of, social media data. The article concludes by considering how research into critical data literacies might connect in more meaningful and effective ways with everyday lived experiences of social media use. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={In higher education programs that train students for professions with high standards of safety, such as aviation, shipping and healthcare, exercises in simulated environments provide opportunities for training in educational settings. This study explores the use of simulators in maritime education, taking an interest in how navigation training is achieved by using simulated environments. By conducting an interaction analysis of video data, the study examines how training students to coordinate with other vessels in traffic is topicalized in simulator exercises, focusing on discourses of temporality in instructions. The results show how instruction during simulations is a continuous interactional achievement built on the ability to assess the fit between the assessment criteria at work in the specifics of the situation and the ongoing tasks as they unfold. During simulations temporality becomes a matter for instruction, both when assessing how to develop the students’ understanding and as a topic in its own right. The results highlight tightly coupled relationships among tasks, instruction and technology. The implications for simulator-based training call for refocusing on training tasks rather than specific skills, and emphasize the importance of professional guidance in order to guide the students toward the discourses of maritime work practice in simulator-based training. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Objective: This paper reports on how the clinical consultation in primary care is performed under the new premises of patients’ daily self-reporting and self-generation of data. The aim was to explore and describe the structure, topic initiation and patients’ contributions in follow-up consultations after eight weeks of self-reporting through a mobile phone-based hypertension self-management support system. Design: A qualitative, explorative study design was used, examining 20 audio- (n = 10) and video-recorded (n = 10) follow-up consultations in primary care hypertension management, through interaction analysis. Clinical trials registry: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01510301. Setting: Four primary health care centers in Sweden. Subjects: Patients with hypertension (n = 20) and their health care professional (n = 7). Results: The consultations comprised three phases: opening, examination and closing. The most common topic was blood pressure (BP) put in relation to self-reported variables, for example, physical activity and stress. Topic initiation was distributed symmetrically between parties and BP talk was lifestyle-centered. The patients’ contributed to the interpretation of BP values by connecting them to specific occasions, providing insights to the link between BP measurements and everyday life activities. Conclusion: Patients’ contribution through interpretations of BP values to specific situations in their own lives brought on consultations where the patient as a person in context became salient. Further, the patients’ and health care professionals’ equal contribution during the consultations showed actively involved patients. The mobile phone-based self-management support system can thus be used to support patient involvement in consultations with a person-centered approach in primary care hypertension managementKey points The clinical consultation is important to provide opportunities for patients to gain understanding of factors affecting high blood pressure, and for health care professionals to motivate and promote changes in life-style.This study shows that self-reporting as base for follow-up consultations in primary care hypertension management can support patients and professionals to equal participation in clinical consultations.Self-reporting combined with increased patient–health care professional interaction during follow-up consultations can support patients in understanding the blood pressure value in relation to their daily life.These findings implicate that the interactive mobile phone self-management support system has potential to support current transformations of patients as recipients of primary care, to being actively involved in their own health. © 2018 The Author(s).

Swedish teachers often use thematic Facebook groups to discuss the subjects they teach, their approaches, methods and assessment. Although previous research has shown that teachers’ participation in social media has a positive impact on teachers’ professional learning, the interaction is described as relatively straightforward and superficial. In this study, we use computational approaches to identify 79 in-depth discussion threads that help uncover the norms of teachers’ social media groups. These threads are analysed in detail using the concept of professional identity work (Goffman, 1959). The findings show that the discussion threads were formulated as questions or requests, and reveal ways teachers engage in extensive professional identity work by drawing on established norms to position themselves as legitimate Facebook group members and as professional teachers.},

abstract={This article theorizes the functional relationship between the human components (i.e., scholars) and non-human components (i.e., structural configurations) of academic domains. It is organized around the following question: in what ways have scholars formed and been formed by the structural configurations of their academic domain? The article uses as a case study the academic domain of education and technology to examine this question. Its authorship approach is innovative, with a worldwide collection of academics (99 authors) collaborating to address the proposed question based on their reflections on daily social and academic practices. This collaboration followed a three-round process of contributions via email. Analysis of these scholars’ reflective accounts was carried out, and a theoretical proposition was established from this analysis. The proposition is of a mutual (yet not necessarily balanced) power (and therefore political) relationship between the human and non-human constituents of an academic realm, with the two shaping one another. One implication of this proposition is that these non-human elements exist as political ‘actors’, just like their human counterparts, having ‘agency’ – which they exercise over humans. This turns academic domains into political (functional or dysfunctional) ‘battlefields’ wherein both humans and non-humans engage in political activities and actions that form the identity of the academic domain.

abstract={The educational use of technology has remained on the periphery of the sociological gaze for a number of wholly understandable reasons. In comparison to other areas of society, education offers a rather underwhelming case study of the technological. Sociologists wishing to gain rich insights into the dynamic nature of technology use in everyday life are best advised to look elsewhere. Conversely, the grand narratives that dominate sociological accounts of education touch rarely upon technology use. At a micro-level of analysis, sociologists of education continue to direct their attention towards unpacking enduring issues of inequality, resistance, identity and culture which pattern the processes and practices of ‘doing education’. Macro-level studies, on the other hand, remain concentrated on issues of social mobility and the entrenched stratification of educational opportunities and outcomes (see Delamont, 2000). Whilst implicated in many of these issues, ‘technology’ has simply not merited any particular foregrounding within such accounts.1 Yet whereas the ŉew’ information technologies of the 1980s and 1990s could be said in the hindsight to have been little more than tokenistic additions to educational settings, digital technologies now constitute an ever-increasing presence within the processes and practices of contemporary education. © Kate Orton-Johnson and Nick Prior 2013 and their respective authors 2013.},

abstract={The use of information and communications technology (ICT) to facilitate easy access to lifelong learning for all is one of the central tenets of the UK government's drive to establish a ‘learning society’. At the heart of initiatives such as the ‘University for Industry’ and ‘learndirect’ are the objectives of increasing access to educational opportunities, thereby widening adult participation in lifelong learning. In so doing the government has invested considerable faith (and finance) in the role of ICT as the primary means of overcoming traditional barriers to lifelong learning. Yet, to date, this growing area of adult education remains over-discussed and under-researched. This article therefore presents an initial empirical examination of the nature of this apparently ‘new’ form of adult learning. Utilising the concept of ‘learning trajectories’ and based on in-depth interviews with 36 adult learners in four different ICT-based settings this article examines: (i) the extent to which ICT can be said to be widening participation in learning to previously ‘disengaged’ adults; and (ii) the experiences, attitudes and views of those learners currently participating in ICT-based learning. © 2002, © 2002 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article considers growing calls for the integration of so-called ‘maker technologies’ and associated ‘maker’ practices into schools and other formal education settings. Moving on from the largely celebratory literature in this area, the article seeks to further explore the tensions between the educational potential of maker technology and the realities of its use in school and classroom contexts. In particular, the article focuses on fundamental–but so far little acknowledged–tensions surrounding the social, cultural, political contexts of maker education, alongside the epistemological and pedagogical characteristics of maker technologies as tools for learning. It is concluded that maker education must not be seen as a ready fit with formal schooling. Instead, teachers and schools are likely to require sustained support to make the most of maker technologies within the demands and constraints of contemporary school contexts. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.},

Studies have shown that digital technologies are sometimes used to replace analogue artefacts in educational settings. This calls for studies on how the use of apps transforms preschool activities. This study empirically investigates how preschool children play Memory games in both digital and analogue form and how the artefacts mediate and re-mediate the children’s engagement. The findings show that two types of Memory games evolved into distinctively different kinds of activities. Our results indicate that it is a complex matter to predict learning outcomes from specific games and calls for a more nuanced discussion on how digital artefacts can mediate and re-mediate activities. © 2018 The Author(s).

In particular, the article explores the ‘back-stage’ issues surrounding data–e.g. concerns and tensions associated with appropriate uses of data; the organisational cultures that form around the use of data; and the (un)intended consequences of data work. These findings point towards an implicit ‘black-boxing’ of data that shapes the generation and use of digital data in ways that are predominantly restricted and bounded.

abstract={Today's high schools are increasingly based around the use of digital technologies. Students and teachers are encouraged to 'Bring Your Own Device', teaching takes place through 'learning management systems' and educators are rushing to implement innovations such as flipped classrooms, personalized learning, analytics and 'maker' technologies. Yet despite these developments, the core processes of school appear to have altered little over the past 50 years. As the twenty-first century progresses, concerns are growing that the basic model of 'school' is 'broken' and no longer 'fit for purpose'. This book moves beyond the hype and examines the everyday realities of digital technology use in today's high schools. Based on a major ethnographic study of three contrasting Australian schools, the authors lay bare the reasons underlying the inconsistent impact of digital technologies on day-to-day schooling. The book examines leadership and management of technology in schools, the changing nature of teachers' work in the digital age, as well as student (mis)uses of technologies in and out of classrooms. In-depth case studies are presented of the adoption of personalized learning apps, social media and 3D printers. These investigations all lead to a detailed understanding of why schools make use of digital technologies in the ways that they do. Everyday Schooling in the Digital Age: High School, High Tech? offers a revealing analysis of the realities of contemporary schools and schooling - drawing on arguments and debates from various academic literatures such as policy studies, sociology of education, social studies of technology, media and communication studies. Over the course of ten wide-ranging chapters, a range of suggestions are developed as to how the full potential of digital technology might be realized within schools. Written in a detailed but accessible manner, this book offers an ambitious critique that is essential reading for anyone interested in the fast-changing nature of contemporary education. © 2018 Neil Selwyn, Selena Nemorin, Scott Bulfin and Nicola F.

abstract={Two related ethnographic research projects on mathematics teacher education in Sweden are presented in this paper. They represent a response to recent policy developments that reaffirm the value of authoritative subject studies content as the central and most important component in the professional knowledge base of would-be teachers and concomitant increases in the amount of subject studies in teacher education. These policy changes, in Sweden at least, lack scientific research support and the article argues that these policies need to be seriously rethought, as the increased emphasis on subject content may undermine the development of key professional skills. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={“Persons in the shadows” may substantially affect how an individual acquires expertise, through, for example, guiding deliberate practice. In the domain of popular music, such persons in the shadows might be peers, parents and teachers. Little research exists on how individuals perceive the impact of persons in the shadows on expertise development, particularly in fields like popular music. This study investigates the perceived impact exerted by peers, parents and teachers on the expertise development of guitarists in the domain of popular music. Interviews were used to investigate nine case studies of guitarists with different expertise levels (experts, sub-experts, amateurs). The main focus was on the roles of “persons in the shadows” concerning practising, learning and motivation. The results show that experts differ from sub-experts and amateurs in the perception of support from persons in the shadows. In particular, peers and the formation of bands were thought of having a strong effect on practising, learning and motivation. The impact of parents and teachers on the expertise development in guitar playing was perceived as more ambiguous, and they were deemed as less important by the expert group. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Large quantities of personal data are now being generated, collated and processed through young people's uses of social media. Third parties increasingly use these data to profile, predict and position the individuals they are associated with. These developments have prompted calls for individuals to adopt more informed and critical stances toward how and why their data is being used - i.e., to become vigilant 'data citizens'. Against this background, this paper reports on an ongoing project that explores the extent to which social media users are aware of their personal data and its attendant issues and uses. Drawing on participatory design research with four diverse groups of young people (aged 14 to 18 years), this paper investigates the possibilities of making third party (re)uses of personal data openly available in digitized form for young people to access, interpret and use to develop counter-practices and resistant tactics. The results of these interventions - while only partially successful - provide valuable insights into the technical, informatic, organizational and social issues surrounding how young people engage with social media, and how academic concerns over data relate to everyday lived experiences of social media use in a digital age. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={While mobile phones can be empowering, constant access to a world of people and information can also bring distraction from the present moment and from the people and things that are physically present in ways that are sometimes unwanted. Excessive use of mobile phones can also have negative consequences on our sleep and concentration. In many respects mobile phones are challenging for our general mental wellbeing. Many designers are now looking into ways to better support mental wellbeing, be it through apps for mindfulness and meditation, or the better design of notifications and sleep modes. People are also developing strategies and ways of coping with the negative aspects of mobile technology, from self-control based approaches such as uninstalling social media apps or not keeping phones by the bedside, to more practice-based approaches such as meditation.

abstract={From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, schools micro-computing in the UK developed from being a niche 'hobbyist' activity to a prominent, officially mandated element of the national education system. Drawing on in-depth interviews with key actors of the time, this paper outlines the initial varied interpretations of schools micro-computing in the UK, identifying the social groups that were involved in pursuing these interpretations, and then considering which meanings and values gained dominance over others. This 'social shaping' analysis highlights the processes that underpinned the gradual stabilisation of the meaning(s) around the micro-computer in an educational context. The paper concludes by considering how the eventually dominant interpretations of schools micro-computing can be explained in terms of the technological frames of relevant social groups-not least the differing determinist assumptions of groups hoping to encourage the radical computer-led transformation of schools and schooling, as opposed to those seeking the continuation of established interests. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper examines the emergence of schools 'micro-computing' in the UK between 1977 and 1984 - a period of significant educational, technological and political change. During this time, computing developed rapidly from a niche activity in a few select schools to the state subsidized purchasing of a 'computer in every school' and the nationwide promotion of computers as a feature of curriculum and pedagogy. Through a series of in-depth retrospective interviews with key policy actors (n=20) this paper develops a detailed 'policy historiography' of this period - shedding light on the complex power relations and interests that underpinned these developments. In particular, the paper highlights the origins of these policy interventions in earlier activities, and examines the negotiations and conflicts between and within the two government departments involved in the mass introduction of computing into the UK school system. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This article addresses the deliberately speculative question of ‘What might the school of 2030 be like?’, with a specific focus on the influences of digital technologies. The article adopts the methodological approach of ‘social science fiction’ to explore the ways in which digital technologies might be used in one Australian high school in 2030 (Lakeside), and what this might mean for the people whose lives are enmeshed with these technologies. Through the co-construction of five social science fiction ‘vignettes’ about life within Lakeside, the article considers the increasing prevalence of dataveillance, digital deskilling and the de-territorialization of schooling. The article then goes on to consider changing relationships between time/place, material and coded structures, as well as the increasingly platformized and data-driven nature of schooling in the 2020s. The article ends by considering the ways in which critical scholars can continue to use the methodological approach of social science fiction writing with regard to unpacking the politics of digital education futures. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this paper, we examine selfies as a situated practice, connecting the social media phenomenon to the local spaces where it is performed. Based on ethnographic studies of selfie photography, we present and discuss three aspects of selfies in the wild. First, we consider selfies as part of a larger photographic context and show how they are often taken in series with other genres of images. Second, we expand upon the notion of selfies as conversation and show how selfie photographers exchange messages with remote friends and followers while attending to the local environment. Third, we discuss socializing around selfies, examining how copresent friends socialize around the production of selfies. These findings show the importance of considering selfies beyond the online context, and highlight the many ways that selfies are interweaved with our everyday activities. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={In Maritime Education and Training (MET) where students are trained for professions with high standards of safety, the use of simulators is taken to provide opportunities for safe and cost‐effective training. Although the use of simulators for training and certifying technical proficiency and so‐called non‐technical skills is well established and regulated by international standards, previous research suggests that simulatorbased assessment has been poorly implemented in the MET system. Now the challenge is to contribute with knowledge about how to conduct consistent, unbiased, and transparent assessments of navigational skills and competencies. However, in current research it is not evident how training of non‐technical skills in simulated environments should be assessed. The aim of this study is to explore the pedagogical challenges instructors face when assessing students’ navigational skills and competencies in a simulated environment. The study is based on video‐recorded data from the certification part in a navigation course for second year master mariner students. A situated approach to cognition and learning is employed to analyze the co‐construction of assessment in the simulated exercises by means of instructors’ questions and students’ answers. Results reveal an assessment practice where the students are still developing their navigational skills with instructional support from examiners whilst being certified on using Radar equipment in accordance to COLREG. © 2019, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

abstract={Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life. This includes the burgeoning integration of facial recognition and facial detection into compulsory schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection. So far, these technologies have largely been seen as routine additions to school systems with already extensive cultures of monitoring and surveillance. While critical commentators are beginning to question the pedagogical limitations of facially driven learning, other this article contends that school-based facial recognition presents a number of other social challenges and concerns that merit specific attention. This includes the likelihood of facial recognition technology altering the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines. Against this background, the article considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made for allowing this form of technology in schools. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={In Applied AI, or ‘machine learning’, methods such as neural networks are used to train computers to perform tasks without human intervention. In this article, we question the applicability of these methods to education. In particular, we consider a case of recent attempts from data scientists to add AI elements to a handful of online learning environments, such as Khan Academy and the ASSISTments intelligent tutoring system. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS), we provide a detailed examination of the scholarly work carried out by several data scientists around the use of ‘deep learning’ to predict aspects of educational performance. This approach draws attention to relations between various (problematic) units of analysis: flawed data, partially incomprehensible computational methods, narrow forms of educational’ knowledge baked into the online environments, and a reductionist discourse of data science with evident economic ramifications. These relations can be framed ethnographically as a ‘controversy’ that casts doubts on AI as an objective scientific endeavour, whilst illuminating the confusions, the disagreements and the economic interests that surround its implementations. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, less is known about processes and factors that underpin the acquisition of such adaptations. The present study investigated how prior experience, cognitive skills, task difficulty and practice effect eye-hand span (EHS) and performance in video gaming. Thirty-three participants played a platformer video game in a pre-test/practice/post-test experiment. Eye movements and keypresses were recorded. The results show that a short practice period improved performance but did not increase EHS. Instead, EHS was related to task difficulty. Furthermore, while EHS correlated with initial performance, this effect seemed to diminish after practice. Cognitive skills (concentration endurance, working memory, mental flexibility and executive functioning) predicted performance in some parts of the experiment. The study offers insights into the early development of visual adaptations and performance. © 2018 International Group for Eye Movement Research.},

Based on analysis of a corpus of social media posts collected as part of an ethnographic study at a natural history museum, the authors show how, alongside the museum’s own curatorial processes, visitors increasingly use content provided by the museum for their own photographic explorations. Focusing particularly on Instagram, it is argued that visitors re-categorize and re-configure museum exhibitions in their presentations on social media. The relationship between this photographic practice and those of the hunters and taxidermists who contributed specimens to museums is explored, and the implications for our understanding of snapshot photography are discussed. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Joshua A.

abstract={As part of the Learning, Media & Technology series on ‘Key Thinkers and Theoretical Traditions’, this paper explores the relevance of C. Wright Mills’ much lauded book ‘The Sociological Imagination’. The argument is made that we would do well to take heed of many of the central tenets of Mills’ call to arms for a historically aware, politically focused and carefully crafted social science. These include Mills’ concerns over the dominance of abstract empiricism, being beholden to the demands of ‘bureaucratic’ research agendas, a tendency towards psychologism and/or resorting to default explanations of the apparent failings of individuals and institutions in terms of a cultural/technological ‘lag’. The paper argues how Mills’ writing should inspire researchers to think beyond the realms of their own experiences, interests and passions, to look beyond the shallow allure of the latest ‘new’ technology, and to critically engage with the social, historical, biographical and political dimensions of education and technology. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The present study investigates whether medical students’ prior knowledge and perceptions about basic biomedical sciences predict learning of these topics at early phases of the medical education. Participants (N = 115) were first year medical students at the University of Turku (Finland). The data consisted of a student perception questionnaire, entrance examination results, and the examination scores of the first year preclinical courses. Compared to the students having only education at the upper secondary school level (n = 58), the students with prior university studies in sciences (n = 57) performed better in the first year course examinations. Out of the four entrance examination subtests, only the subtest in biology predicted performance in the first year course examinations. In terms of students’ perceptions, the students rated the courses that dealt with the human body on microscopic or molecular level the least useful and the most difficult. Yet, the perception of usefulness had no effect on examination performance. The results emphasize the role prior knowledge especially in biology has for learning of medicine. Furthermore, the first year medical students seem to value topics that are more closely related to their everyday experiences and, therefore, perhaps less abstract. The courses on cellular and molecular levels were rated notably low with regard to usefulness. The relevance of cellular and molecular biology to medical profession should be communicated more clearly to the students. Furthermore, basic science topics may benefit from a more integrative pedagogical approach in which the biomedical concepts are conceptualized in diagnostic practice. © 2016, International Association of Medical Science Educators.},

abstract={Purpose – In this study, online in-service training for people employed in the food production industry is scrutinized. The purpose of this study is to analyse how the participants adapt to such online environments in terms of the kind of discussions they establish. The more specific interest relates to how the participants discuss current work experiences in relation to the contents of quality assurance they are expected to learn. Design/methodology/approach – The data analyzed are Web discussions in forms of chat log files from ten courses. Findings – The results show that, on the one hand, general principles have to be substantiated in the form of concrete examples to actually function as principles and, on the other hand, concrete examples are made interesting only if they have a bearing on a more general issue. Another interesting finding is that the course participants gradually take over the vocabulary of quality assurance; they more frequently write about their work in terms of, e.g. criteria, relevance, estimations and hazards. The conclusion is that Web discussions as part of in-service training constitute a new arena for reflection in and on practice. Originality/value – This is interesting to explore, as it is designed to meet the needs of employers and employees to learn the new set of rules and procedures, which regulate the European food industry. In this respect, the training activities are of direct relevance to daily work practices. Simultaneously, online environments seem to offer flexibility and thus constitute a solution for training in a dispersed industry. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Many people, connected through the Internet, are contributing ideas and information to several projects in business and science. Crowdsourcing can offer individuals and opportunity for sharing their expertise, express their creativity, and learn new knowledge and skills. However, this model of technology-enabled collective collaborative process, where a known few are replaced by an indefinite many, has deep and diverse implications for education, especially for self-directed learning. Crowdsourcing can be disruptive and this disruption can have both positive and negative consequences for teaching and learning.

Learning and remembering are understood as meaning-making processes that are dependent on and co-constituted by mediating tools that enable practices to extend across time and space. Our interests are precisely in what ways the “tools” people employ in these studies mediate activities of learning and remembering, and how they contribute to the organization of collective forms of knowing. We also address how we analyze the specific material features of tools that co-determine the unfolding of the activities. © ISLS},

abstract={This article examines the role of materials in education by investigating the inclusion of a handheld digital technology in mathematics classrooms. By drawing on activity theory to conceptualize learning with technology and Actor-Network theory to understand the relationships between materials and humans, the use of educational technology in two secondary school mathematics classrooms is investigated. Drawing on interviews and video-recorded classroom observation, this investigation maps the patterns of relations among humans and materials as classroom socio-technical networks adapt to the inclusion of a handheld digital technology. The results present a variety of ways that the human and material actors in classroom socio-technical networks operate as an interconnected whole rather than as a set of individual interactions. © 2011 FQS.},

abstract={Although the increased use of information and communications technology (ICT) in undergraduate degree courses has been signalled as one of the defining features of higher education over the next decade, students' use of computers whilst in university remains inconsistent. Using focus group interviews with 77 accounting undergraduates in two higher education institutions, this article explores the rationales and motivations underlying students' engagement with ICT during their degree programmes. These were seen by students from three perspectives: short-term factors (i.e. students' immediate concerns with coursework assignments, examinations and other forms of degree work and assessment), medium-term factors (i.e. course-related concerns culminating in their final degree classification), and long-term factors (i.e. the need and usefulness of ICT in relation to future life and employment prospects). The article then discusses how and why ICT has only partially succeeded in permeating students' conceptualisations of all three of these stages; arguing that low levels of ICT use in university should not be seen as a deficiency or inability on the part of students, rather a pragmatic and strategic choice in the face of prevailing academic and employment demands. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Despite two decades of computer use in schools and colleges, considerable differences persist in levels of IT use throughout all levels of education. Within institutions it is noticeable that huge variations in computer use exist between different subject areas, yet little analytical work has been carried out to explore the reasons behind this. On the basis of interviews with 96 students and 20 teachers in 16-19 education, this article examines the underlying influences behind the varying levels of computer use in different subject areas. In particular, the influence of subject ‘cultures’ are highlighted as having a significant effect on teachers’ and students’ use of IT in school, most notably in terms of subject content, pedagogy and assessment. Furthermore, subjects were found to differ in terms of their cultures of interest and access to IT within the institution. On the basis of these data, conclusions are then drawn as to alleviating subject differences in the use of IT. © 1999, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In many countries it has been noticeable how students’ use of information technology (IT) in education is often sporadic and inconsistent; at odds with the esteemed status that IT is afforded in educational rhetoric and policy. The traditional approach to the uneven take-up of IT in education has been to concentrate on the deficiency of the student in not using computers. In this way students’ avoidance of IT use is often framed in terms of a psychological inability or deficiency to react with computers. However, this article attempts to look beyond this traditional ‘discourse of deficiency’ and explore the myriad factors influencing students’ decisions not to use computers during their education. On the basis of data gathered from focus group interviews with 96 UK students, three main constructs underlying students’ rejection of educational computing are identified. The article discusses how educational computing can be ‘re-constructed’ in the light of these factors. Résumé Dans de nombreux pays, on a remarqué combien l’usage que font les étudiants des technologies de l’information (IT) en éducation est souvent sporadique et inconsistant, très loin du statut des IT généralement attribu‚ dans le discours rhétorique et politique sur l’éducation. L’approche traditionnelle de la difficulté a été‚ focalisée sur les déficiences de l’étudiant qui n’utilise pas l’ordinateur. Dans ce sens, le fait que l’étudiant cherche à éviter l’usage des IT est souvent formul‚ en termes d’inaptitude psychologique ou de déficience dans les réactions face à l’ordinateur. Cette étude cherche à voir plus loin que ce discours traditionnel de déficience de l’étudiant et explore la myriade de facteurs qui influencent les décisions de l’étudiant de ne pas utiliser l’ordinateur pour étudier. Sur la base de données recueillies lors d’interviews touchant 96 étudiants de Grande-Bretagne, trois types de rejets sous-jacents de l’informatique éducationnelle ont été identifiés. Le document discute la manière dont celle-ci peut être ‘re-construite’ à la lumière de ces facteurs. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={As information technology (IT) becomes increasingly commonplace in society, computer-related courses have also risen in popularity among adult learners. However, despite the growth in numbers enrolling, adult IT learners remain an under-researched element of educational computing research. This paper reports on a study of adult learners (n=138) enrolled on a part-time IT course in a South Wales college. In particular the background of students choosing to take IT-related courses was examined along with their attitudes and prior experience of computers. Questions were also asked regarding adults' motivations behind enrolling on such a course. The paper concludes that different groups of adults are choosing to study computing for a variety of reasonsincluding work and career purposes, studying the subject for its own sake and wanting to be able to use a computer at home. Gender was not found to be a significant factor although the advantage of having access to a home computer was confirmed. The paper concludes with recommendations for the focusing of adult IT courses onto learners' specific needs and requirements. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
